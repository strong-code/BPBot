2012-08-27 09:55:10 oatzhakok said: i thought bulking for women was a terrible idea...
2012-08-27 09:55:13 oatzhakok said: they just get fat
2012-08-27 09:55:25 Blice said: oatzhakok: only if they're already normal weight
2012-08-27 09:55:29 workerbee said: i'm trying to start now :<
2012-08-27 09:55:34 Blice said: bulking is a great idea if they are underweight, clearly
2012-08-27 09:55:40 Blice said: workerbee: no I mean a real bulk
2012-08-27 09:55:40 Blice said: like
2012-08-27 09:55:42 Blice said: counting calories

2012-08-27 09:55:52 workerbee said: ohh, well, i dunno!
2012-08-27 09:56:04 x4nti said: counting calories is the difference between a real bulk and a fake bulk
2012-08-27 09:56:04 workerbee said: oatzhakok: my bmi is 14.3, i need to bulk
2012-08-27 09:56:27 oatzhakok said: what's a healthy bmi again?
2012-08-27 09:56:32 Blice said: if you are prone to undereating naturally then you just need to count them

2012-08-27 09:57:11 Bucketecaf said: kool
2012-08-27 09:57:26 Blice said: the only way to put on my muscle is to bulk, and you might put on a small layer of fat with that muscle,
2012-08-27 09:57:27 Bucketecaf said: Blice, you have the same problem as workerbee only with more fat
2012-08-27 09:57:29 Blice said: but you can lose the fat afterwards

2012-08-27 09:59:37 oatzhakok said: in this respect
2012-08-27 09:59:48 oatzhakok said: the reason bulking is effective for men
2012-08-27 09:59:55 oatzhakok said: is the amount of test we naturally have
2012-08-27 09:59:58 oatzhakok said: woman have so litle

2012-08-27 10:00:10 oatzhakok said: i'm not just making this up Blice
2012-08-27 10:00:15 Blice said: and the only way to do that is to eat more than you expend
2012-08-27 10:00:18 Blice said: and that's called a bulk
2012-08-27 10:00:20 oatzhakok said: i'm not talking specifically about workerbee
2012-08-27 10:00:23 Blice said: oh

2012-08-27 10:00:44 oatzhakok said: and that's not better than what she is now
2012-08-27 10:00:50 Blice said: she has to gain weight
2012-08-27 10:01:05 oatzhakok said: doesn't mean she has to gain it all by september
2012-08-27 10:01:08 oatzhakok said: she can take her time
2012-08-27 10:01:13 oatzhakok said: and do it in a healthy way
2012-08-27 10:01:15 Blice said: so a slow bulk
2012-08-27 10:01:21 oatzhakok said: stop saying bulk
2012-08-27 10:01:30 oatzhakok said: it imples you're eating a large caloric surplus
2012-08-27 10:01:35 Blice said: no it doesn't
2012-08-27 10:01:39 oatzhakok said: yes it does
2012-08-27 10:01:43 Blice said: it implies you're eating ~500 over maintenance

2012-08-27 10:02:06 Blice said: bulking doesn't automatically imply fucking gomad
2012-08-27 10:02:10 Blice said: and a stick of buter
2012-08-27 10:02:13 Blice said: and chugging olive oil
2012-08-27 10:02:31 Blice said: its suggested for good bulking to do 500 over maintanence, and for good cutting to do 500 under
2012-08-27 10:03:26 oatzhakok said: 500 over maintenance does fuck all for me
2012-08-27 10:03:34 oatzhakok said: i gotta gain a couple lbs a week

2012-08-27 10:38:58 ferrum said: fuck, the whole last month of lifting did nothing for my squat
2012-08-27 10:39:04 ferrum said: regressed exactly a month to the day
2012-08-27 10:42:39 Blice said: ;;

2012-08-27 10:42:53 Blice said: ferrum: you know what that mean
2012-08-27 10:43:01 Bucketphase said: nah
2012-08-27 10:43:13 Bucketphase said: i think ferrum has finally hit the point where squatting is hard
2012-08-27 10:43:19 Bucketphase said: it just took a long time cause his rom is only a few inches
2012-08-27 10:43:25 nookbee said: bulk moar?
2012-08-27 10:43:32 Bucketphase said: he cant
2012-08-27 10:43:37 Bucketphase said: weight classes etc
2012-08-27 10:43:46 nookbee said: o ye
2012-08-27 10:43:48 Bucketphase said: tbh ferrum you might not make any records this year
2012-08-27 10:43:54 Bucketphase said: because
2012-08-27 10:44:03 Bucketphase said: you've been bulking so long your body is just all out of wack
2012-08-27 10:44:32 ferrum said: I'm guaranteed to make the age group record
2012-08-27 10:46:15 Blice said: I think ferrum is just done with intermediate gains on squat
2012-08-27 10:46:29 Bucketphase said: probably
2012-08-27 10:46:40 Bucketphase said: texas method is not something you should do for much more than 6 months i reckon
2012-08-27 10:46:49 Bucketphase said: ferrum's been doing it like a year
2012-08-27 10:47:12 Blice said: ferrum: start your light-medium-heavy cycles weekly instead of daily, monthly progression
2012-08-27 10:47:19 Blice said: there's a few routines out there for that
2012-08-27 10:47:45 Bucketphase said: switch to 531 after your meet ferrum
2012-08-27 10:47:48 Bucketphase said: imho
2012-08-27 11:01:08 ferrum said: yeah
2012-08-27 11:01:12 ferrum said: I can't wait to get off 5x5
2012-08-27 11:01:15 ferrum said: it's such a pain in the ass
2012-08-27 11:04:55 oatzhakok said: don't you only squat 1x week on 5/3/1?
2012-08-27 11:05:44 ferrum said: you have options, but usually 5/3/1 is 4x training a week, each lift is given its own day
2012-08-27 11:06:03 oatzhakok said: i feel like just once a week isn't enough
2012-08-27 11:06:06 oatzhakok said: but idunno
2012-08-27 11:06:15 oatzhakok said: i'll never do 5/3/1 so i'll never find out
2012-08-27 11:06:19 ferrum said: russian squat training is once a week
2012-08-27 11:06:21 ferrum said: it's probably enough
2012-08-27 11:06:35 Bucketphase said: depends on your level/recovery oatzhakok
2012-08-27 11:06:49 oatzhakok said: i squat every time i'm in the gy
2012-08-27 11:06:59 oatzhakok said: but
2012-08-27 11:07:04 oatzhakok said: i'm between programs so
2012-08-27 11:07:08 oatzhakok said: we'll see what happens
2012-08-27 11:07:18 nookbee said: meeting over~
2012-08-27 11:08:44 Blice said: ferrum: you could do madcow's 5x5 advanced
2012-08-27 11:08:50 Blice said: where you have a volume week, deload week, and peak week
2012-08-27 11:21:10 workerbee said: also oatzhakok and Blice, i obv want to gain the weight in a healthy way (not just stuff myself w/ fastfood and cake etc), but then again i should gain the weight ASAP just in case i get hecka lucky and can leave early for bootcamp...
2012-08-27 11:21:28 ferrum said: Blice: oh good, more 5x5 :)
2012-08-27 11:21:32 Blice said: :D
2012-08-27 11:25:33 Bucketphase said: madcow was never convincing for me
2012-08-27 11:36:10 Blice said: madcow got the programs from glenn
2012-08-27 11:37:48 Blice said: http://madcow.hostzi.com/5x5_Program/Periodized_5x5.htm
2012-08-27 11:38:29 Bucketphase said: i dont care who glenn pendlay is
2012-08-27 11:38:34 Bucketphase said: or who's cow it is
2012-08-27 11:40:47 ferrum said: madcow 5x5 is very different from TM
2012-08-27 11:40:53 ferrum said: TM is 5x5 sets across, madcow is 5x5 ramping
2012-08-27 11:41:49 ferrum said: " If your top set of 5 is 315, you might go 135, 185, 225, 275, and then 315 all for 5 reps."
2012-08-27 11:42:02 BradPitt said: Blice
2012-08-27 11:42:04 BradPitt said: check it out
2012-08-27 11:42:04 ferrum said: so really using rippetoe verbs, madcow 5x5 is just 1x5 with warmup
2012-08-27 11:42:06 BradPitt said: .quote madcow
2012-08-27 11:42:07 BradPitt said: .quote madcow

2012-08-27 11:42:28 ferrum said: how are those all Quote 1
2012-08-27 11:42:36 BradPitt said: they aren't numerically number 1
2012-08-27 11:42:46 ferrum said: they're astrologically #1?
2012-08-27 11:42:51 BradPitt said: ferrum pls
2012-08-27 11:43:07 BradPitt said: it greps the log file, adds all matches to a list, then plucks one randomly
2012-08-27 11:43:13 BradPitt said: and tells you how many else there are
2012-08-27 11:43:22 ferrum said: ok, but shouldn't doing that be deterministic
2012-08-27 11:43:45 BradPitt said: yes master
2012-08-27 11:44:30 ferrum said: anyway, before zyzz interrupted
2012-08-27 11:44:41 ferrum said: 11:40 <&ferrum> madcow 5x5 is very different from TM
2012-08-27 11:44:41 ferrum said: 11:40 <&ferrum> TM is 5x5 sets across, madcow is 5x5 ramping
2012-08-27 11:44:41 ferrum said: 11:41 <&ferrum> " If your top set of 5 is 315, you might go 135, 185, 225, 275, and then 315 all for 5 reps."
2012-08-27 11:44:45 ferrum said: 11:42 <&ferrum> so really using rippetoe verbs, madcow 5x5 is just 1x5 with warmup
2012-08-27 11:46:51 Blice said: anyway ferrum what do you think of that advanced program?
2012-08-27 11:47:29 ferrum said: I don't know how to evaluate advanced programs, and that's still 1x5
2012-08-27 11:47:36 ferrum said: when madcow says 5x5 he's an idiot
2012-08-27 11:48:14 Blice said: that's the terminology that bill starr used, ferrum
2012-08-27 11:48:18 Blice said: 5x5 ramping sets
2012-08-27 11:48:26 Blice said: that's from bill's program and madcow put it in there
2012-08-27 11:48:45 ferrum said: we know better now
2012-08-27 11:51:03 Blice said: also 5x5 ramping sets is not the same as a warmup
2012-08-27 11:51:17 Blice said: a wamrup is 5x5, 4x5, 3x5, 2x5, 1x5, workset
2012-08-27 11:51:20 ferrum said: yes I'm being intentionally snooty for comedic effect
2012-08-27 11:51:24 _vex_ said: Should one train to failure on SS or not?
2012-08-27 11:51:24 Blice said: er
2012-08-27 11:51:27 Blice said: no said that wrong lol
2012-08-27 11:51:33 Blice said: 1x5, 1x4, 1x3, 1x2, 1x1
2012-08-27 11:51:43 Blice said: oh
2012-08-27 11:51:45 ferrum said: that sounds like "pyramiding"
2012-08-27 11:51:50 ferrum said: and not like "warmup up"
2012-08-27 11:51:52 ferrum said: warming
2012-08-27 11:51:53 Blice said: ferrum please be less snooty
2012-08-27 11:51:58 oatzhakok said: _vex_: no
2012-08-27 11:52:02 oatzhakok said: that isn't ss
2012-08-27 11:52:05 oatzhakok said: that's something else
2012-08-27 11:52:22 _vex_ said: So one should avoid training to failure on ss?
2012-08-27 11:52:31 oatzhakok said: yes
2012-08-27 11:52:40 oatzhakok said: if you fail on the 3x5
2012-08-27 11:52:43 oatzhakok said: you aren't eating enough
2012-08-27 11:52:50 oatzhakok said: or should try something else
2012-08-27 11:53:07 _vex_ said: yes, but then that means I shouldn't do 5-5-7 even if I'm capable?
2012-08-27 11:53:13 ferrum said: _vex_: yeps
2012-08-27 11:53:14 oatzhakok said: correct
2012-08-27 11:53:19 _vex_ said: oh.. I guess I've messed up
2012-08-27 11:53:35 _vex_ said: can anyone give a pointer or some reasoning?
2012-08-27 11:53:52 _vex_ said: I searched in the book but can't find anything, and don't recall anything about it in there
2012-08-27 11:53:55 oatzhakok said: can't recover as well when you've trained to failure
2012-08-27 11:54:02 ferrum said: _vex_: if you can do 3 more reps, then you can do more weight on the 3x5, and you'll be adding 5 lbs in 2 days anyway
2012-08-27 11:54:14 ferrum said: _vex_: we know that linear 3x5 works, so don't fuck with it
2012-08-27 11:54:53 ferrum said: also what oatzhakok said; every time I fail squats I'm dead for 3-4 days
2012-08-27 11:55:09 _vex_ said: I see, thanks. I guess this might be a reason for an earlier stall I did
2012-08-27 11:55:18 _vex_ said: though I just bought smaller plates to combat it
2012-08-27 11:55:52 _vex_ said: does this also mean that tricep extension 3x8 as accessory work on OHP day to really tire my triceps is a very bad idea?
2012-08-27 11:56:01 oatzhakok said: correct
2012-08-27 11:56:13 oatzhakok said: triceps also get hit hard on bench day
2012-08-27 11:56:19 oatzhakok said: don't mess with the program
2012-08-27 11:56:27 _vex_ said: and here I was thinking triceps were limiting me by not being worked enough
2012-08-27 11:56:28 oatzhakok said: you'll get plenty big if you eat right
2012-08-27 11:56:34 ferrum said: only accessory work I've found that doesn't interfere with SS is hammer db curls
2012-08-27 11:56:42 ferrum said: everything else interferes and will spoil the main lifts
2012-08-27 11:56:43 Bucketphase said: the funny thing i dont understand is
2012-08-27 11:56:50 Bucketphase said: people do 50x50 curls
2012-08-27 11:56:53 Bucketphase said: or 50x50 leg curls
2012-08-27 11:56:58 ferrum said: 2.5lbs weighted, RAW
2012-08-27 11:57:09 Bucketphase said: then say "i failed squats today, whta could this be?"
2012-08-27 11:57:16 Bucketphase said: 99% of the pople that lift are retards
2012-08-27 11:57:34 ferrum said: which is sad, because lifting is a fun science
2012-08-27 11:57:40 oatzhakok said: ^
2012-08-27 11:57:41 _vex_ said: I'm still keeping chinups though, right?
2012-08-27 11:57:48 _vex_ said: pullups, actually
2012-08-27 11:57:54 BradPitt said: pullups > chins
2012-08-27 11:57:55 oatzhakok said: how many can you do?
2012-08-27 11:57:57 ferrum said: pullups interfere with ohp but whatever
2012-08-27 11:58:03 ferrum said: chins > pullups since chins have bicep involvement
2012-08-27 11:58:03 _vex_ said: doing 9-7-6 or so right now
2012-08-27 11:58:05 Stefano said: I always train to failure on squats dl and bench but I do them once a week
2012-08-27 11:58:05 _vex_ said: unweighted
2012-08-27 11:58:10 BradPitt said: hardly, ferrum
2012-08-27 11:58:11 _vex_ said: and that's chinups from dead hang
2012-08-27 11:58:18 oatzhakok said: just do 3x5 if you really want to
2012-08-27 11:58:18 _vex_ said: oops
2012-08-27 11:58:21 oatzhakok said: do'nt do them to failure
2012-08-27 11:58:22 ferrum said: BradPitt: I did nothing but chins and I curl more than u ;)
2012-08-27 11:58:22 _vex_ said: crap.. I mean pullups
2012-08-27 11:58:39 BradPitt said: pullup power should come from rhomboids, lats and bis
2012-08-27 11:58:44 BradPitt said: OHP should come from tris and delts
2012-08-27 11:58:53 ferrum said: OHP is all upper back
2012-08-27 11:58:55 Bucketphase said: that's simple ferrum do pullups after ohp
2012-08-27 11:58:57 ferrum said: tricep is used in the beginning
2012-08-27 11:59:05 ferrum said: after you pass above the head it's all upper back to lockout
2012-08-27 11:59:17 Bucketphase said: not completely tru
2012-08-27 11:59:18 Bucketphase said: e
2012-08-27 11:59:22 _vex_ said: so I keep the pullups and don't do them to failure? 3x8 or 3x5?
2012-08-27 11:59:30 oatzhakok said: if you want
2012-08-27 11:59:35 oatzhakok said: just don't do them to failure
2012-08-27 11:59:42 ferrum said: _vex_: do them weighted, it's more fun
2012-08-27 11:59:46 BradPitt said: keep them, do to failure
2012-08-27 11:59:49 _vex_ said: I'll get to it ferrum
2012-08-27 11:59:52 BradPitt said: if you hit 10+ do them weighted
2012-08-27 12:00:02 ferrum said: 3x5 is best I think
2012-08-27 12:00:13 ferrum said: I did 3x8 myself, but it stopped working after a while
2012-08-27 12:00:16 ferrum said: 3x5 has been steady
2012-08-27 12:00:18 ferrum said: for chins, not pullups
2012-08-27 12:00:36 _vex_ said: should I do pullups 3 days or 1¬Ω days per week?
2012-08-27 12:00:50 Bucketphase said: 2 days
2012-08-27 12:00:58 ferrum said: rarely
2012-08-27 12:01:02 Bucketphase said: how can you do them 1.5 days a week
2012-08-27 12:01:13 ferrum said: Bucketphase: expected value of avg(2, 1)
2012-08-27 12:01:25 ferrum said: A/B switching on SS
2012-08-27 12:01:48 _vex_ said: == Bucketphase [~Kinky_Che@tres.anticonformiste] has left #lifting [Leaving]
2012-08-27 12:01:52 _vex_ said: don't you love that
2012-08-27 12:02:17 _vex_ said: question still stands though
2012-08-27 12:02:30 oatzhakok said: just do them 2x a week
2012-08-27 12:02:34 oatzhakok said: on mon and fri
2012-08-27 12:02:57 ferrum said: _vex_: I don't remember, but here's my training log: http://fpaste.org/GdoY/
2012-08-27 12:03:09 ferrum said: can search for "chins"
2012-08-27 12:03:27 ferrum said: I stopped doing them these days
2012-08-27 12:03:34 _vex_ said: I like your style
2012-08-27 12:03:35 oatzhakok said: why is that?
2012-08-27 12:03:44 ferrum said: training for PL competition
2012-08-27 12:03:53 oatzhakok said: and they're interfering?
2012-08-27 12:03:58 ferrum said: yeah
2012-08-27 12:04:09 oatzhakok said: ( ‚âñ‚Äø‚âñ) that was the answer i was looking for
2012-08-27 12:04:11 oatzhakok said: (‚âñ‚ÅÄ‚âñ )
2012-08-27 12:05:12 _vex_ said: it's nice with some help by the way, I appreciate it
2012-08-27 12:05:25 oatzhakok said: np broseph
2012-08-27 12:07:40 _vex_ said: I must have wasted so much time in the beginning, doing ABxABx, barely any rest, a billion exercises, not enough food
2012-08-27 12:07:46 _vex_ said: that feeling of regret..
2012-08-27 12:07:54 ferrum said: everyone has done that
2012-08-27 12:08:10 ferrum said: my log doesn't include the months I spent on machines B)
2012-08-27 12:08:43 _vex_ said: and then there's the whole "why didn't I start two years earlier" thing
2012-08-27 12:08:48 _vex_ said: but oh well, better late than never

2012-08-27 12:09:36 _vex_ said: my experience is that it's really tough and stressing the first month or so, sick DOMS and such
2012-08-27 12:09:47 _vex_ said: so it would have to be an ongoing course where students saw results before they were allowed to quit

2012-08-27 22:04:35 ferrum said: when the hamstrings relaxed, it became a quad-only squat, and I had to force it up
2012-08-27 22:04:38 ferrum said: this kills the quads

2012-08-27 23:26:35 ferrum said: it certainly feels a lot looser now
2012-08-27 23:26:56 ferrum said: attempting to do stuff that mimic a tricep pulldown doesn't hurt
2012-08-27 23:27:19 ferrum said: did it with a knee wrap

2012-08-27 23:50:12 thootwoops said: lol
2012-08-27 23:50:28 thootwoops said: for low bar, your arms are still holding the bar in place right?
2012-08-27 23:50:34 BradPitt said: yes
2012-08-27 23:50:40 thootwoops said: like if you had perfect low bar form, and let go of the bar, it wouldn't stay there would it?
2012-08-27 23:52:29 wonderbeaver said: read ss
2012-08-27 23:52:38 wonderbeaver said: read the wiki
2012-08-27 23:52:55 thootwoops said: thx 4 the advice m8
2012-08-27 23:52:58 wonderbeaver said: np
2012-08-27 23:53:57 thootwoops said: according to SS, if your knees move forward at the bottom of the squat, it means your hamstrings have relaxed
2012-08-27 23:55:33 BradPitt said: yes
2012-08-27 23:56:09 thootwoops said: looking down (as SS advised) on my low weight reps, my knees looked pretty good, not too far forward
2012-08-27 23:56:30 thootwoops said: tried making them only move at the start of the descent, and then having my ass go out and back for the rest
2012-08-27 23:56:39 thootwoops said: but on the high weight sets it just felt bad overall
2012-08-27 23:56:58 thootwoops said: having to lean so far forward while standing with the weight feels retarded
2012-08-27 23:57:14 thootwoops said: and it was harder to get my ass to go back at weight
2012-08-28 00:10:18 ferrum said: thootwoops: I often let go of the bar during reps
2012-08-28 00:10:33 ferrum said: during a 5RM it can occasionally slide a little bit, and I use the time at the bottom to readjust it
2012-08-28 00:11:00 ferrum said: it's the shelf that you make with your arms that holds the bar up, not your hands
2012-08-28 00:20:16 thootwoops said: I had my hands as tight as they could go on the bar, and was pushing my elbows up like you're supposed to
2012-08-28 00:20:41 thootwoops said: tight together* on the bar
2012-08-28 00:21:07 thootwoops said: my wrists were straight as fuck and I had my thumbs on top, idk why my wrists felt so shitty
2012-08-28 00:21:25 ferrum said: maybe your wrists are weak and this is a natural part of the adaptation process
2012-08-28 00:24:33 thootwoops said: my wrists and hands look so shit
2012-08-28 00:25:06 thootwoops said: fucking grandma wrist/hands
2012-08-28 00:25:17 thootwoops said: small as fuck and you can see all the veins and tendons and shit
2012-08-28 00:25:24 thootwoops said: and it's fucking genetic

2012-08-28 12:03:49 ferrum said: it's a good theory though
2012-08-28 12:03:54 ferrum said: works at lower weights

2012-08-28 12:04:21 Blice said: yes they are
2012-08-28 12:04:25 Blice said: they are held back by front squat
2012-08-28 12:04:27 ferrum said: they can squat way more than they are in competition, squat isn't the limiting factor
2012-08-28 12:04:32 Blice said: they can back squat way more

2012-08-28 12:04:59 Blice said: front squat becomes the limiting factor as your clean form gets closer to perfect

2012-08-28 12:05:20 Blice said: I mean jerk is always the limiting factor in the clean & jerk
2012-08-28 12:05:21 ferrum said: source: I watched like all the london 2012 lifting
2012-08-28 12:05:30 ferrum said: right, so the weight they choose is that which can be jerked
2012-08-28 12:05:33 oatzhakok said: ferrum: occasionally they will fail after the catch
2012-08-28 12:05:41 oatzhakok said: but it is rare
2012-08-28 12:05:47 ferrum said: well sometimes they just don't get it high enough at all, yeah
2012-08-28 12:05:47 Blice said: ferrum: you can tell the recovery is hard as fuck anyway
2012-08-28 12:05:48 oatzhakok said: and usually means that their technique wasn't good
2012-08-28 12:05:57 ferrum said: their squat technique is hilarious btw

2012-08-28 12:06:36 ferrum said: anyway the point is that you're not going to get a great bounce if you're doing near-maximal weights
2012-08-28 12:06:39 ferrum said: at least in my experience
2012-08-28 12:06:44 Blice said: you get a bounce atg
2012-08-28 12:06:46 ferrum said: you can feel it a little
2012-08-28 12:06:51 Blice said: literal bounce from hamstrings and calv contact
2012-08-28 12:07:00 ferrum said: yes, that is distinctly what we do not do

2012-08-28 12:08:15 ferrum said: and it's still difficult to tell if I'm going below parallel
2012-08-28 12:08:26 Blice said: look in the mirror :D
2012-08-28 12:08:32 Blice said: look between your legs
2012-08-28 12:08:33 ferrum said: I actually used to do that and it worked perfectly fine
2012-08-28 12:08:36 ferrum said: the former
2012-08-28 12:08:44 ferrum said: but I'm trying to keep head-down now, and it's messing with form
2012-08-28 12:09:21 ferrum said: also my lower back is failing occasionally because my 3RM squat is about 10lbs off my maximal 1RM deadlift
2012-08-28 12:09:25 ferrum said: \o-

2012-08-29 07:25:21 jbb said: your feet are too wide probbles and thats why your knees are pointing in so much
2012-08-29 07:26:35 _vex_ said: is it bad? I forgot consciously pushing them out
2012-08-29 07:27:15 _vex_ said: though they really won't go much further out than that, maybe 5cm each
2012-08-29 07:27:48 _vex_ said: actually I see, you're right
2012-08-29 07:27:53 Bucketphase said: stance is too wide
2012-08-29 07:27:55 Bucketphase said: by a million miles
2012-08-29 07:28:04 _vex_ said: really? I used to do much wider
2012-08-29 07:28:07 Bucketphase said: supposed to be shoulder width
2012-08-29 07:28:09 Bucketphase said: not elbow width

2012-08-29 07:29:14 Bucketphase said: i know i'm right
2012-08-29 07:29:30 jbb said: i think you could do with moving up a bit with the bench
2012-08-29 07:29:37 _vex_ said: yes, but if I followed to word of anyone just throwing advice at me without confirming I'd be the victim of endless trolling :)
2012-08-29 07:29:50 _vex_ said: jbb: Moving up in weight?
2012-08-29 07:29:53 jbb said: nipples closer to the bar

2012-08-29 07:30:36 _vex_ said: jbb: I feel that keeping it like this makes the lift a LOT easier for me.. But yes, angle is horrible
2012-08-29 07:30:37 Bucketphase said: your bench is really wobbly
2012-08-29 07:30:41 Bucketphase said: you could arch your back more
2012-08-29 07:30:45 Bucketphase said: pull your shoulders in more
2012-08-29 07:30:47 jbb said: im assuming your heels are on the floor for the bench too?
2012-08-29 07:30:51 Bucketphase said: and you could unrack it a bit better
2012-08-29 07:30:57 _vex_ said: no jbb, they are pushing towards the floor but not touching
2012-08-29 07:31:10 jbb said: ^ unrack with locked shoulders
2012-08-29 07:31:50 _vex_ said: can you elaborate on what you mean when you say locked shoulders, jbb?
2012-08-29 07:31:50 jbb said: and squeeze your shoulder blades together
2012-08-29 07:32:19 Bucketphase said: chest out
2012-08-29 07:32:27 Bucketphase said: shoulder blades together
2012-08-29 07:32:34 _vex_ said: ah yes, I forgot that, definitely
2012-08-29 07:32:48 jbb said: and get a better accent

2012-08-29 07:33:40 _vex_ said: Danish
2012-08-29 07:34:26 Bucketphase said: danish is an awful language
2012-08-29 07:34:37 Bucketphase said: can you believe they have the audacity to complain about norwegian
2012-08-29 07:34:39 Bucketphase said: when they sound like that

2012-08-29 07:35:47 _vex_ said: So.. More narrow stance for squat, shoulder blades pinched together for bench, arch more (though I have no idea how, it's already very hard on my lower back)
2012-08-29 07:35:57 _vex_ said: I really appreciate the feedback, so many things I didn't notice on my own
2012-08-29 07:36:03 _vex_ said: is there anything else?
2012-08-29 07:36:21 jbb said: make sure your legs are perpendicular to the floor
2012-08-29 07:36:26 jbb said: and not angled in or out
2012-08-29 07:37:14 _vex_ said: do you mean my feet?
2012-08-29 07:37:22 _vex_ said: otherwise I'm not sure I understand
2012-08-29 07:37:37 jbb said: legs
2012-08-29 07:37:48 jbb said: dont have them winging in or out
2012-08-29 07:38:40 _vex_ said: so they should be parallel with each other, the two legs?
2012-08-29 07:38:52 _vex_ said: (more or less)
2012-08-29 07:38:56 jbb said: no
2012-08-29 07:39:12 Bucketphase said: are you talking about bench jbb?
2012-08-29 07:39:20 jbb said: squat sorry
2012-08-29 07:39:26 Bucketphase said: um
2012-08-29 07:39:29 Bucketphase said: you mean shins?
2012-08-29 07:39:40 _vex_ said: that'd make sense
2012-08-29 07:39:50 Bucketphase said: dont sweat it, if your knees are going in the right direction
2012-08-29 07:39:55 Bucketphase said: your legs will be okay
2012-08-29 07:39:56 jbb said: what i mean is
2012-08-29 07:39:58 _vex_ said: though I will really have a hard time keeping my balance
2012-08-29 07:40:05 Bucketphase said: unless you lean forward too much
2012-08-29 07:40:09 jbb said: both your upper and lower legs should both be on the same vertical plane
2012-08-29 07:40:15 jbb said: more or less
2012-08-29 07:40:20 Bucketphase said: jbb is telling you to stand up
2012-08-29 07:40:21 Bucketphase said: basically
2012-08-29 07:40:33 jbb said: at the bottom of the squat
2012-08-29 07:40:37 Bucketphase said: or else he doesnt know what perpendickyler means
2012-08-29 07:40:39 _vex_ said: you mean I'm using too much hip drive?
2012-08-29 07:40:43 Bucketphase said: just
2012-08-29 07:40:44 Bucketphase said: forget it
2012-08-29 07:40:56 jbb said: haha
2012-08-29 07:41:17 jbb said: it's hard to explain but you got what you need anyway
2012-08-29 07:41:31 _vex_ said: no wonder my hip flexors were hurting in the beginning when I was squatting 20cm wider
2012-08-29 07:41:48 Bucketphase said: well that's retarded
2012-08-29 07:41:49 Bucketphase said: good job
2012-08-29 07:42:05 _vex_ said: I was sure I'd read somewhere that you need a stance wider than shoulders
2012-08-29 07:42:09 _vex_ said: but that's wrong
2012-08-29 07:42:15 Raggles said: <_vex_> you mean I'm using too much hip drive?
2012-08-29 07:42:16 Raggles said: wat
2012-08-29 07:42:32 Raggles said: just fucking go down and stand back up
2012-08-29 07:42:36 Raggles said: that's how you squat
2012-08-29 07:42:41 _vex_ said: not according to Rip
2012-08-29 07:42:41 Bucketphase said: yeah seriously
2012-08-29 07:42:44 Raggles said: motherfucker
2012-08-29 07:42:45 Bucketphase said: it's not that hard
2012-08-29 07:43:18 _vex_ said: well, my legs were way too wide so I managed to fuck "not that hard up"
2012-08-29 07:43:25 _vex_ said: can't hurt to ask
2012-08-29 07:43:31 _vex_ said: but yes, I see, thanks
2012-08-29 07:44:13 jbb said: SQUATS SQUATS SQUATS SQUATS SQUATS SQUATS
2012-08-29 07:44:51 _vex_ said: jbb: At the bench, are you sure I should go higher? Right now I'm 3cm below nipples or so, and trying to go vertically up
2012-08-29 07:45:18 _vex_ said: and I'm not sure I *can* arch any more than this, I realize it looked not-very-tight in the video but in real life it feels hella tight
2012-08-29 07:45:29 Bucketphase said: it looked fine tbh
2012-08-29 07:45:34 Bucketphase said: just too wobbly and not tight enough
2012-08-29 07:45:50 Raggles said: aka
2012-08-29 07:45:53 Raggles said: use less weight
2012-08-29 07:45:57 Raggles said: you wanker
2012-08-29 07:46:05 _vex_ said: if I can get 3x5 then why?
2012-08-29 07:46:10 Raggles said: okay
2012-08-29 07:46:12 jbb said: up back until you can just comfortably do your rom without the rack interfering
2012-08-29 07:46:18 Raggles said: i can 3x5 20lbs over my 3x5
2012-08-29 07:46:22 Raggles said: that doesn't mean i do it
2012-08-29 07:46:31 _vex_ said: okay, my previous statement was retarded
2012-08-29 07:46:34 jbb said: lol
2012-08-29 07:46:36 jbb said: yea
2012-08-29 07:47:16 oatzhakok said: _vex_: do you do high bar or low bar swuats?
2012-08-29 07:47:16 _vex_ said: though I'm doing SS and the goal is to increase the weight every time
2012-08-29 07:47:18 Raggles said: if your form is breaking down towards the last reps
2012-08-29 07:47:22 _vex_ said: oatzhakok: Lowbar
2012-08-29 07:47:23 Raggles said: or it's an extreme struggle
2012-08-29 07:47:24 oatzhakok said: kk
2012-08-29 07:47:29 oatzhakok said: then i have nothing to contribute
2012-08-29 07:47:29 Raggles said: then just fucking use less weight
2012-08-29 07:47:29 oatzhakok said: ( ‚âñ‚Äø‚âñ)
2012-08-29 07:47:53 _vex_ said: thanks anyway oatz
2012-08-29 07:47:58 Raggles said: it's very easy to get ahead of yourself while on SS
2012-08-29 07:48:01 _vex_ said: Raggles: So I should deload?
2012-08-29 07:48:08 Raggles said: since you can add so much weight so fast
2012-08-29 07:48:24 Raggles said: people tend to end up putting too much on too quickly
2012-08-29 07:48:41 Raggles said: no don't deload wtf
2012-08-29 07:48:48 _vex_ said: what should I do instead then?
2012-08-29 07:48:50 Raggles said: just use like 30lbs less
2012-08-29 07:48:53 Raggles said: and go from there
2012-08-29 07:49:02 _vex_ said: 30 lbs is a huge percentage
2012-08-29 07:49:06 Raggles said: yeah
2012-08-29 07:49:10 Raggles said: do it
2012-08-29 07:49:17 Raggles said: it never hurts to go too low
2012-08-29 07:49:28 _vex_ said: that's a 22% deload
2012-08-29 07:49:38 _vex_ said: I don't feel ready for that
2012-08-29 07:49:40 Raggles said: and then add 56-10lbs per workout from there
2012-08-29 07:49:47 Raggles said: 5*
2012-08-29 07:49:50 _vex_ said: oh, like that
2012-08-29 07:50:07 Raggles said: deload implies you will jump back up to what you were struggling with the week before
2012-08-29 07:50:11 Raggles said: don't do that
2012-08-29 07:50:17 Raggles said: just drop the weight and go from there
2012-08-29 07:50:25 _vex_ said: ah, my definition of the word was wrong
2012-08-29 07:50:32 _vex_ said: o-kay
2012-08-29 07:50:59 _vex_ said: feels like I'll be stuck at this babbyweight forever though
2012-08-29 07:51:27 Raggles said: your problem isn't that you're stalling or plateauing
2012-08-29 07:51:40 Raggles said: you just added too much weight too fast and now your form is braking down
2012-08-29 07:51:49 Raggles said: >braking
2012-08-29 07:52:15 _vex_ said: actually I did stall from 60kgs to 62,5 and had to buy smaller plates
2012-08-29 07:52:18 Raggles said: drop to a weight where your form is no longer hindered by struggle
2012-08-29 07:52:22 Raggles said: and go from there
2012-08-29 07:52:25 _vex_ said: so that's close too
2012-08-29 07:52:53 Raggles said: the only rep you should have any real problems with is the 5th
2012-08-29 07:53:05 Raggles said: if you're on the 3rd or 4th and shaking and struggling
2012-08-29 07:53:10 Raggles said: it's simply too much weight
2012-08-29 07:53:14 _vex_ said: I was
2012-08-29 07:53:33 Raggles said: did you have a video?
2012-08-29 07:53:42 _vex_ said: of what?
2012-08-29 07:53:49 _vex_ said: that was in this video
2012-08-29 07:53:50 Raggles said: bucket said he saw you squat
2012-08-29 07:53:53 _vex_ said: oh
2012-08-29 07:53:58 Bucketphase said: it was like he was trying to bench an open umbrella in a tornado
2012-08-29 07:53:58 Raggles said: yeah I didn't see the vid
2012-08-29 07:54:01 Raggles said: link it
2012-08-29 07:54:10 Bucketphase said: _vex_> Form check please? Any criticism is much appreciated. Squat: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2cbg11d8lE Bench: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBcobuqDCf4
2012-08-29 07:54:15 _vex_ said: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2cbg11d8lE
2012-08-29 07:54:16 _vex_ said: thanks
2012-08-29 07:54:17 Bucketphase said: jeeze raggles
2012-08-29 07:54:33 Raggles said: >red head
2012-08-29 07:54:41 _vex_ said: btw Raggles 3x5 at 55kgs, for example, will not feel very taxing on my body, is this really enough to move on up and keep form good then?
2012-08-29 07:54:49 Raggles said: yes
2012-08-29 07:55:00 Raggles said: as long as you are adding weight every workout/week
2012-08-29 07:55:03 Raggles said: of course
2012-08-29 07:55:17 _vex_ said: but won't I just hit right back into that form trouble when I get back to my current?
2012-08-29 07:55:25 _vex_ said: or, well, you're saying I won't
2012-08-29 07:55:26 Raggles said: your squat looks fine
2012-08-29 07:55:28 _vex_ said: so I guess I'll have to try
2012-08-29 07:55:31 Raggles said: 2 things
2012-08-29 07:55:35 _vex_ said: the other guys said my squat stance is way too wide
2012-08-29 07:55:38 Raggles said: push knees outward at all times
2012-08-29 07:55:49 _vex_ said: and yes, to push knees out
2012-08-29 07:55:50 Raggles said: don;t let them buckle in at all or you're just losing strength
2012-08-29 07:56:00 Raggles said: and grip the bar closer is
2012-08-29 07:56:09 Raggles said: squeeze your shoulder blades together
2012-08-29 07:56:20 Raggles said: close in*
2012-08-29 07:56:23 Raggles said: that's all
2012-08-29 07:56:28 Raggles said: looks fine overall though
2012-08-29 07:56:28 Bucketphase said: you can't push your knees outwards when your feet are that wide
2012-08-29 07:56:33 Raggles said: ^
2012-08-29 07:56:37 _vex_ said: right, thanks
2012-08-29 07:56:38 Raggles said: that too
2012-08-29 07:56:52 Raggles said: shoulder width or a little wider than shoulder width
2012-08-29 07:56:55 Raggles said: don't get crazy
2012-08-29 07:57:12 _vex_ said: I just thought wider was right
2012-08-29 07:57:16 _vex_ said: I was wrong
2012-08-29 07:57:16 Raggles said: you aren't teabagging memguu
2012-08-29 07:57:19 Bucketphase said: yeah no big
2012-08-29 07:57:44 Raggles said: Bucketphase why does this chloe girl give me a boner
2012-08-29 07:57:47 _vex_ said: thanks for the advice then
2012-08-29 07:58:10 Bucketphase said: what chloe girl
2012-08-29 07:58:16 Raggles said: moretz
2012-08-29 07:58:24 Raggles said: what is this feel
2012-08-29 07:58:40 _vex_ said: narrower stance, push knees out, be tighter at bench, go down to lower weight, pinch shoulder blades together
2012-08-29 07:58:43 _vex_ said: better write this down
2012-08-29 07:59:14 Raggles said: and make sure you aren't rocking forward with the weight
2012-08-29 07:59:30 Raggles said: if the weight comes off of your heels the hamstrings immediately disengage
2012-08-29 07:59:32 _vex_ said: vertical lines only, yes?
2012-08-29 07:59:38 Raggles said: and you lose half your power
2012-08-29 07:59:48 _vex_ said: over midfoot
2012-08-29 07:59:48 oatzhakok said: more than half
2012-08-29 07:59:53 oatzhakok said: hamstrings are strong as fuck
2012-08-29 07:59:59 Raggles said: just concentrate on keeping the weight on your heels
2012-08-29 08:00:27 Raggles said: if you don't you end up with giant quads and babby hamstrings
2012-08-29 08:00:30 Raggles said: and you look like an idiot
2012-08-29 08:00:56 Raggles said: worse than nelo legs
2012-08-29 08:01:02 Bucketphase said: the feel of pedo
2012-08-29 08:01:08 Raggles said: ;_;
2012-08-29 08:01:15 Bucketphase said: Raggles, kool down
2012-08-29 08:01:18 Bucketphase said: he's a beginner
2012-08-29 08:01:28 Bucketphase said: he asks dumb questions
2012-08-29 08:01:29 Bucketphase said: sure
2012-08-29 08:01:33 Bucketphase said: but dont insult him for being a beginner
2012-08-29 08:01:41 Raggles said: when did i do that
2012-08-29 08:01:45 _vex_ said: if you're talking about me, I don't feel insulted
2012-08-29 08:01:46 Bucketphase said: just then
2012-08-29 08:01:47 _vex_ said: I feel helped
2012-08-29 08:01:48 Raggles said: when did i call this fucking loser anything
2012-08-29 08:01:53 _vex_ said: hey now
2012-08-29 08:01:57 Raggles said: jk bro
2012-08-29 08:01:58 Bucketphase said: lay off the haterade
2012-08-29 08:02:00 _vex_ said: :)
2012-08-29 08:02:01 Raggles said: you have tasty lips
2012-08-29 08:02:26 Raggles said: oh jesus
2012-08-29 08:02:30 Raggles said: she was born in 97
2012-08-29 08:02:31 Raggles said: oh god
2012-08-29 08:03:04 Bucketphase said: too old for you?
2012-08-29 08:03:16 Raggles said: just right B)
2012-08-29 08:03:33 Bucketphase said: you and memguu are basially hte same person now
2012-08-29 08:03:34 Bucketphase said: good job
2012-08-29 08:05:12 Raggles said: i didn't watch your bench video _vex_
2012-08-29 08:05:17 Raggles said: it's probably fine
2012-08-29 08:05:24 Raggles said: you can't really fuck up benching
2012-08-29 08:05:40 Raggles said: the only nitpicking would be that you aren't benching like a powerlifter
2012-08-29 08:05:49 Raggles said: which isn;t really that important
2012-08-29 08:05:57 Bucketphase said: he fucks it up
2012-08-29 08:06:05 Bucketphase said: http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/314970_10151221934504453_918373352_n.jpg this was me
2012-08-29 08:06:13 Raggles said: lol
2012-08-29 08:06:44 Raggles said: wtf kind of bench is this
2012-08-29 08:07:04 Raggles said: >benching in the curl rack
2012-08-29 08:07:42 Raggles said: wtf is going on
2012-08-29 08:07:51 Raggles said: wtf is going on
2012-08-29 08:07:58 Raggles said: why are there bars
2012-08-29 08:08:12 Raggles said: why does it have trainingwheels
2012-08-29 08:08:25 Raggles said: Bucketphase im very confused
2012-08-29 08:09:31 _vex_ said: wat
2012-08-29 08:09:35 _vex_ said: not benching like a PL?
2012-08-29 08:09:53 Raggles said: hip drive etc for bench
2012-08-29 08:09:58 _vex_ said: oh
2012-08-29 08:10:05 _vex_ said:  I was strength, not to move lotsa weight
2012-08-29 08:10:08 _vex_ said: want*
2012-08-29 08:10:19 Raggles said: it's good form to use though
2012-08-29 08:10:22 Raggles said: in general
2012-08-29 08:10:23 Raggles said: and
2012-08-29 08:10:24 Raggles said: ffs
2012-08-29 08:10:26 _vex_ said: isn't hip drive cheating?
2012-08-29 08:10:32 Bucketphase said: no
2012-08-29 08:10:35 Raggles said: do you have any normal squat racks at that gym
2012-08-29 08:10:36 Bucketphase said: the way you're benching is simply wrong
2012-08-29 08:10:36 Bucketphase said: enjoy
2012-08-29 08:10:55 _vex_ said: no, I don't have anything but a power rack, but I did switch gyms and am waiting for this membership to run out
2012-08-29 08:10:57 Raggles said: not one from the starship enterprise
2012-08-29 08:11:11 Raggles said: okay
2012-08-29 08:11:24 Raggles said: i mean
2012-08-29 08:11:35 Raggles said: until you get under a free barbell
2012-08-29 08:11:42 Raggles said: you aren't going to get form down
2012-08-29 08:11:57 Raggles said: that thing is just ridiculous
2012-08-29 08:11:58 Bucketphase said: it looks like a free barbel ltbh
2012-08-29 08:12:06 Raggles said: it's on rails
2012-08-29 08:12:06 Bucketphase said: it's not a regular smith at least
2012-08-29 08:12:11 _vex_ said: it's 2-dimensional free, not 3 like a free weight
2012-08-29 08:12:17 Raggles said: and smith bars are always fucky
2012-08-29 08:12:18 _vex_ said: but not pure smith machine either
2012-08-29 08:12:24 Raggles said: the bar doesn't weigh 45lbs
2012-08-29 08:13:08 Raggles said: i remember having to use the smith machine at my gym once when i first started
2012-08-29 08:13:16 Raggles said: and i could bench 1 plate on it no problem
2012-08-29 08:13:24 Raggles said: at a time when i was benching like 100lbs
2012-08-29 08:13:30 _vex_ said: I do want to point out this isn't a smith machine, but yes, smiths are fucked
2012-08-29 08:13:35 oatzhakok said: isn't the smith machine only 1d free?
2012-08-29 08:13:37 oatzhakok said: up/down?
2012-08-29 08:13:39 _vex_ said: yes
2012-08-29 08:13:39 _vex_ said: it is
2012-08-29 08:13:41 oatzhakok said: ok
2012-08-29 08:13:42 oatzhakok said: (‚âñ‚ÅÄ‚âñ )
2012-08-29 08:13:46 _vex_ said: <Bucketphase> the way you're benching is simply wrong
2012-08-29 08:13:47 _vex_ said: ;_;
2012-08-29 08:13:49 Raggles said: this is some kind of fuckery machine
2012-08-29 08:13:57 Raggles said: _vex_
2012-08-29 08:14:11 Raggles said: i could sit here all day trying to explain to you how to bench correctly
2012-08-29 08:14:15 Raggles said: but watch this instead
2012-08-29 08:14:28 Raggles said: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krvj3HgYlVc
2012-08-29 08:14:39 Raggles said: it explains how to bench right plain and simple
2012-08-29 08:14:53 _vex_ said: watched their "So you think you can bench" already
2012-08-29 08:14:56 _vex_ said: but let me give this a try too
2012-08-29 08:15:03 Raggles said: just watch this
2012-08-29 08:19:47 _vex_ said: I am squeezing the bar, I am arching and keeping whole body (including legs) tight, I think I'm keeping wrists in proper position and bar in line, I'm keeping the bar still before I start benching after unracking, I haven't paid explosiveness any mind
2012-08-29 08:20:14 _vex_ said: I think this video position/angle just makes me look very non-tight
2012-08-29 08:20:20 Raggles said: the bar has a ton of lateral movement when you're benching
2012-08-29 08:20:29 Raggles said: just concentrate on minimizing that
2012-08-29 08:21:13 _vex_ said: so you mean I should keep it going in a completely vertical path, without any disturbances?
2012-08-29 08:28:19 Raggles said: well slight on an angle
2012-08-29 08:28:29 Raggles said: but it shouldn't be shaking back and forth all over
2012-08-29 08:28:42 Raggles said: it should be a downward sloped motion
2012-08-29 08:28:49 Raggles said: from to to bottom
2012-08-29 08:28:54 Raggles said: top*
2012-08-29 08:29:00 _vex_ said: alright, I'll focus on that, thanks

2012-08-29 15:54:08 ferrum said: I am at work though, no 4chan for now
2012-08-29 15:54:31 ferrum said: people have applauded when I finished squatting, oatzhakok
2012-08-29 15:54:32 oatzhakok said: yeah
2012-08-29 15:54:35 oatzhakok said: he's 5'8" 215
2012-08-29 15:54:36 ferrum said: one kid told me I was his hero
2012-08-29 15:54:39 oatzhakok said: looks pretty solid
2012-08-29 15:54:41 ferrum said: B)
2012-08-29 15:54:45 oatzhakok said: but his squat is only 385
2012-08-29 15:54:57 ferrum said: that's pretty typical
2012-08-29 15:55:06 oatzhakok said: is it?
2012-08-29 15:55:10 ferrum said: there's a guy in my gym who can't seem to get past 380 no matter what he tries
2012-08-29 15:55:16 ferrum said: told me he's been stuck there for years
2012-08-29 15:55:21 oatzhakok said: wat
2012-08-29 15:55:23 ferrum said: he's trying paused squats and all sorts of stupid shit
2012-08-29 15:55:23 oatzhakok said: that's cray cray
2012-08-29 15:55:29 ferrum said: onijin-tier
2012-08-29 15:55:34 oatzhakok said: i'd understand if it was a really technical lift
2012-08-29 15:55:42 ferrum said: 380 high-bar
2012-08-29 15:55:44 Number1Stunna said: you lift too often, bp
2012-08-29 15:55:47 oatzhakok said: but that's so weird for skwayz
2012-08-29 15:55:48 Number1Stunna said: that's why you get injured
2012-08-29 15:56:03 oatzhakok said: BradPitt: are your quads over dominant?
2012-08-29 15:56:37 oatzhakok said: bought a new lifting belt today
2012-08-29 15:56:42 oatzhakok said: one that will actually fit
2012-08-29 15:56:42 oatzhakok said: :DD
2012-08-29 15:56:57 oatzhakok said: my old one barely fit even when i was super fat
2012-08-29 15:57:17 Stefano said: what do you do to go past that ferrum
2012-08-29 15:57:20 Stefano said: eat more?
2012-08-29 15:58:51 ferrum said: Stefano: intermediate programming
2012-08-29 15:59:09 ferrum said: you have to actually start planning for weekly adaptation
2012-08-29 15:59:13 ferrum said: it's much harder
2012-08-29 15:59:51 oatzhakok said: aren't there a ton of programs for that though?
2012-08-29 16:00:06 ferrum said: yes, thankfully you don't have to figure it out yourself
2012-08-29 16:00:11 ferrum said: although you do have to guess the ratios correctly
2012-08-29 16:00:15 oatzhakok said: cuz that'd suck hardcore style
2012-08-29 16:00:17 oatzhakok said: true
2012-08-29 16:00:29 oatzhakok said: i just did madcow with the lowst percentages
2012-08-29 16:00:35 ferrum said: madcow is 1x5 with ramping
2012-08-29 16:00:40 oatzhakok said: yeah
2012-08-29 16:00:40 ferrum said: TM is 5x5 with no ramping
2012-08-29 16:00:50 ferrum said: I chose the latter because it was closer to SS
2012-08-29 16:00:52 ferrum said: 5x5 is not fun
2012-08-29 16:00:55 oatzhakok said: i can't do that kind of working volume
2012-08-29 16:00:59 oatzhakok said: i squat last
2012-08-29 16:01:05 oatzhakok said: after snatches, cleans and pulls
2012-08-29 16:01:20 oatzhakok said: i'd have to use a ridic low percentage as to not be worthwhile
2012-08-29 16:01:29 oatzhakok said: i don't even do anything over triples anymore anyway
2012-08-29 16:01:32 ferrum said: you wouldn't do that on TM
2012-08-29 16:01:34 oatzhakok said: not worth it
2012-08-29 16:01:42 oatzhakok said: yeah
2012-08-29 16:01:46 oatzhakok said: we have diff goals
2012-08-29 16:01:47 oatzhakok said: (‚âñ‚ÅÄ‚âñ )
2012-08-29 16:01:47 ferrum said: you'd possibly snatch and clean on recovery days
2012-08-29 16:01:57 ferrum said: we probably have similar goals..
2012-08-29 16:02:03 oatzhakok said: sure
2012-08-29 16:02:08 oatzhakok said: but idgaf what my squat is
2012-08-29 16:02:17 oatzhakok said: the difference is the lifts we care about
2012-08-29 16:02:20 ferrum said: squat is just a proxy number for overall strength
2012-08-29 16:02:25 oatzhakok said: true
2012-08-29 16:02:32 ferrum said: that's why I care
2012-08-29 16:02:34 oatzhakok said: but overall strenght is less important to me right now
2012-08-29 16:02:36 ferrum said: not because I want to be good at the squat
2012-08-29 16:02:39 oatzhakok said: cuz technique is my limiting factor
2012-08-29 16:02:51 oatzhakok said: my goal is to snatch 100 by my birthday

2012-08-29 17:54:33 Stefano said: It's impossible to get a 6 pack. Every single picture that you have ever seen of "abs" is a shoop. If you think you have abs when you look at yourself in the mirror, you're just mistaken. It's just the way the lighting hits your fat. I know this as a fact because I'm underweight and I work my abs harder than anything else, but still no six pack. Take it from a pro.

2012-08-29 18:21:43 Blice said: ferrum: the jist is that pointing your toes outwards is a general reccomendation because people lack ankle mobility, but you can actually get better torque with your toes more forward if you have the mobility for it
2012-08-29 18:21:55 Blice said: eg your feet don't lift up on the sides when you shove your knees out
2012-08-29 18:22:07 Blice said: ferrum: this comment on the video is the best,
2012-08-29 18:22:14 Blice said: This is awesome, it's a real nuts and bolts explanation instead of some dudeÔªø saying "drive with your hips and force your butt through your dick. you really wanna force your butt through your dick on this lift. yaa now push. concentrate on the butt and dick aspect of this lift"

2012-08-29 18:23:45 BradPitt said: technically it doesnt
2012-08-29 18:23:47 ferrum said: it had to do with getting the knees out far enough that your hips can drop
2012-08-29 18:23:52 BradPitt said: ankle mobility just allows for proper foot positioning

2012-08-30 18:41:49 ferrum said: so what you're saying is
2012-08-30 18:41:54 ferrum said: I should not be going in the hot tub after exercising
2012-08-30 18:41:58 Number1Stunna said: no you can
2012-08-30 18:42:11 Number1Stunna said: it's all about how animals cool themselves by these spots on their skin with some kind of veins or some shit
2012-08-30 18:42:15 Number1Stunna said: and humans have those in their hands
2012-08-30 18:42:20 Number1Stunna said: and you put this glove on your hand
2012-08-30 18:42:27 Number1Stunna said: and it cools it to a point where blood flow isn't constricted
2012-08-30 18:42:29 Number1Stunna said: but that lowers your core temp
2012-08-30 18:42:37 ferrum said: and then you lift?
2012-08-30 18:42:38 Number1Stunna said: and when that happens, your muscles don't get sore/tired when you're working out
2012-08-30 18:42:44 ferrum said: whoa
2012-08-30 18:42:45 Number1Stunna said: i guess you use it like between sets
2012-08-30 18:42:46 ferrum said: sign me up
2012-08-30 18:42:49 Number1Stunna said: and it eliminates fatigue
2012-08-30 18:43:15 Number1Stunna said: i think it's more to increase endurance rather than strength though
2012-08-30 18:43:22 Number1Stunna said: but i dunno
2012-08-30 18:43:23 ferrum said: they said it worked on bench
2012-08-30 18:43:23 Raggles said: hmm
2012-08-30 18:43:30 ferrum said: if it means I can bench 225 for more reps, that's awesome
2012-08-30 18:43:31 Raggles said: I wonder if it speeds recovery though
2012-08-30 18:43:33 Number1Stunna said: did they say if it increased the weight you coudl bench
2012-08-30 18:43:36 ferrum said: they didn't
2012-08-30 18:43:38 Number1Stunna said: yeah i think it does, Rag
2012-08-30 18:43:40 Raggles said: meaning you could train like 3x a day
2012-08-30 18:43:45 Raggles said: without a diminishing return
2012-08-30 18:43:46 Number1Stunna said: i bet it would still
2012-08-30 18:43:55 Number1Stunna said: yeah i bet it would still not be helpful in terms of like, gains

2012-08-30 20:35:03 Raggles said: how is the protein content of duck meat
2012-08-30 20:50:51 Blice said: unsure
2012-08-30 20:55:12 ferrum said: Herniation of the contents of the disc into the spinal canal often occurs when the anterior side of the disc is compressed while sitting or bending forward, and the contents (nucleus pulposus) get pressed against the tightly stretched and thinned membrane on the posterior side of the disc.
2012-08-30 20:55:32 ferrum said: The combination of membrane thinning from stretching and increased internal pressure (200 to 300 psi) results in the rupture of the confining membrane.
2012-08-30 20:55:54 ferrum said: The jelly-like contents of the disc then move into the spinal canal, pressing against the spinal nerves, thus producing intense and usually disabling pain and other symptoms.

2012-08-30 21:03:22 ferrum said: arch your back way backwards before you start lifting, after the weight applies it'll be about normal

2012-08-30 21:03:48 Blice said: that usually only happens when you apply weight at an odd angle to the back

2012-08-30 21:43:06 ferrum said: the modern one is absolutely amazing
2012-08-30 21:43:24 Raggles said: I'm sure they've created much more intuitive/powerful tools internally
2012-08-30 21:44:54 Raggles said: not many devs that work with unreal even create their own tools for it
2012-08-30 21:45:10 Raggles said: since the publically available tools are so good
2012-08-30 21:45:12 ferrum said: unreal was beautiful, it was so intuitive
2012-08-30 21:45:20 ferrum said: I could make amazing maps in 7th grade without even being taught
2012-08-30 21:45:33 Raggles said: i know Epic games just uses the freely available unreal editor
2012-08-30 21:45:36 ferrum said: yeah

2012-08-30 21:46:08 Raggles said: what a mesh
2012-08-30 21:47:31 ferrum said: unreal doesn't even compile anymore
2012-08-30 21:47:42 ferrum said: they just do all light calculation dynamically

2012-08-31 11:55:15 Blice said: fat = fullness
2012-08-31 11:55:19 workerbee said: they make the skinny recruits eat extra

2012-08-31 12:08:16 workerbee said: just remember, i went from 95 lbs to 107 lbs in less than 5 days :3 granted, a lot was water weight, but 6 lbs were "real" weight
2012-08-31 12:08:36 workerbee said: i def dont want to have to do that again. but i know it wont be too hard for me to gain weight when the time comes

2012-08-31 20:43:21 Raggles said: but that wasn't blood
2012-08-31 20:43:37 Raggles said: blood is the same temperature as your joints
2012-08-31 20:44:12 ferrum said: can't think of anything else warm
2012-08-31 20:44:18 wonderbeaver said: gush of warm blood

2012-08-31 20:46:40 Raggles said: BB bench just seems like such an accident prone movement
2012-08-31 20:46:43 Raggles said: and bb ohp
2012-08-31 20:46:44 Blice said: ferrum: what's your deadlift at?
2012-08-31 20:47:13 ferrum said: max was 475, last time I barely got 445
2012-08-31 20:47:16 ferrum said: so around there
2012-08-31 20:47:33 ferrum said: it's lower than my squat
2012-08-31 20:47:44 ferrum said: tendinitis makes it hard to hold the bar
2012-08-31 20:48:47 Raggles said: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7U4ktcQdog&feature=youtu.be

2012-08-31 20:51:09 Blice said: hrm

2012-08-31 20:51:46 ferrum said: forearm
2012-08-31 20:51:52 Blice said: ouch
2012-08-31 20:51:56 ferrum said: my DL has usually been below my squat
2012-08-31 20:52:00 Blice said: since?
2012-08-31 20:52:06 ferrum said: since I stopped doing DLs :P

2012-08-31 20:52:14 Blice said: what weight did you stop at?
2012-08-31 20:52:19 ferrum said: occasionally I re-test my DL 1RM and am like "oh it went up by 40lbs that's cool"
2012-08-31 20:52:32 ferrum said: when it started interfering with squats, don't remember
2012-08-31 20:52:36 ferrum said: 1RM doesn't interfere
2012-08-31 20:52:40 ferrum said: but doesn't train DL
2012-08-31 20:52:58 Blice said: Raggles: that spotter was soo bad

2012-08-31 20:53:39 Raggles said: after all these fucking benching accident videos are out there on the internet
2012-08-31 20:53:56 Raggles said: people better get their shit together with spotters

2012-08-31 20:54:11 Raggles said: suicide gripping
2012-08-31 20:54:26 ferrum said: vid link or pic clips
2012-08-31 20:54:27 Raggles said: there is 0 benefit
2012-08-31 20:54:31 Raggles said: except killing yourself
2012-08-31 20:54:46 Raggles said: ferrum you really haven't seen it?

2012-08-31 20:55:14 ferrum said: Blice: heh! next time I tested it went up to 465
2012-08-31 20:55:51 Raggles said: actually
2012-08-31 20:56:01 ferrum said: that didn't look like a suicide grip
2012-08-31 20:56:05 Raggles said: this guy isn't even suicide gripping, his thumbs just give out
2012-08-31 20:56:06 Raggles said: weird
2012-08-31 20:56:44 Blice said: it wasn't suicide grip
2012-08-31 20:56:58 ferrum said: also that grip is so close
2012-08-31 20:57:04 ferrum said: can I do that? is that legal? I will switch to that if it's legal
2012-08-31 20:57:15 Blice said: it is legal but it will increase your ROM
2012-08-31 20:57:27 Blice said: usually powerlifters want to widen the grip
2012-08-31 20:58:03 Raggles said: usually powerlifters want to not have the bar drop onto their chest
2012-08-31 20:58:06 ferrum said: for training not for comp
2012-08-31 20:58:33 ferrum said: so what happened to this guy? he put all the weight on the thumbs instead of gripping it properly, I guess
2012-08-31 20:58:49 Raggles said: one of his thumbs may have broken
2012-08-31 20:58:51 Raggles said: who knows
2012-08-31 20:59:12 ferrum said: it's not really supposed to be supported by your thumb
2012-08-31 20:59:15 Raggles said: i've never felt any strain on my thumbs when gripping the bar
2012-08-31 20:59:18 ferrum said: yeah
2012-08-31 20:59:26 ferrum said: it's supposed to be equivalent to suicide grip but with thumb around
2012-08-31 20:59:39 Raggles said: maybe he let it roll severely enough so the weight went to his thumbs
2012-08-31 20:59:40 Raggles said: idk
2012-08-31 21:00:39 Raggles said: torn abdominal cavity
2012-08-31 21:00:42 Raggles said: fucking christ
2012-08-31 21:01:11 Raggles said: even if they stabilized him
2012-08-31 21:01:21 Raggles said: torn abdominal cavity is pretty much a death sentence
2012-08-31 21:01:32 Raggles said: you can't stop the infections
2012-08-31 21:04:36 Blice said: ferrum: he could have just had a blackout for a second or something weird
2012-08-31 21:04:37 Blice said: you know
2012-08-31 21:04:46 Blice said: a fluke
2012-08-31 21:05:01 Raggles said: blacking out mid bench
2012-08-31 21:05:06 ferrum said: he did not black out
2012-08-31 21:05:17 Blice said: not black out but you know what I mean
2012-08-31 21:05:27 Blice said: idk
2012-08-31 21:05:29 Blice said: ._.
2012-08-31 21:05:30 Raggles said: he may have started to faint
2012-08-31 21:05:37 Raggles said: and his grip just flopped
2012-08-31 21:05:58 Raggles said: theres a point when you are fainting
2012-08-31 21:06:03 Raggles said: where you just strop caring
2012-08-31 21:06:05 Raggles said: about anything
2012-08-31 21:06:11 Raggles said: and let go
2012-08-31 21:06:19 Blice said: what I mean though is that the problem could have been unrelated to the lift, lifting, etc.
2012-08-31 21:06:27 Raggles said: even if letting go means 400lbs falling on your chest
2012-08-31 21:06:35 ferrum said: haha that vegan girl got back from that property she put money down for
2012-08-31 21:06:55 ferrum said: "Just got back. 1,300 miles. 15 highways. 29 hours later. The property sucked. There was no decent road within 3 miles of it."
2012-08-31 21:07:12 ferrum said: "Locals started telling me the elevation was too high to grow anything"

2012-09-01 10:07:01 thootwoops said: your gym must have some scales kicking around, just grab the bar and go weigh yourself, then find the difference etc
2012-09-01 10:08:47 Stefano said: there's just one and it's really heavy
2012-09-01 10:09:04 Stefano said: the thing is
2012-09-01 10:09:07 Stefano said: when you unlock the bar
2012-09-01 10:09:09 Stefano said: it doesn't fall
2012-09-01 10:09:11 Stefano said: it stays in position
2012-09-01 10:09:24 Stefano said: it could be that it's balanced to weight nothing idk
2012-09-01 10:09:52 thootwoops said: uhm, unlock the bar?
2012-09-01 10:09:53 Bucketecaf said: the weight might not even be consistent throughout the whole movement
2012-09-01 10:09:57 thootwoops said: care to elaborate?
2012-09-01 10:10:22 thootwoops said: are we talking about a smith machine...?

2012-09-01 10:10:32 Stefano said: it's a smith machine
2012-09-01 10:10:55 thootwoops said: I've only used one like once but yeah they have a little pulley system on some of them
2012-09-01 10:11:14 thootwoops said: if you can unlock the bar and move it wherever and it stays there, then it must be counterbalanced to weigh nothing
2012-09-01 10:11:34 thootwoops said: doesn't your gym have actual barbells?
2012-09-01 10:12:07 Stefano said: yeah it does
2012-09-01 10:12:15 Stefano said: we have a squat rack too I noticed today
2012-09-01 10:12:28 Stefano said: but it's a multi function thing and it's always mounted for pullups
2012-09-01 10:12:33 thootwoops said: then why are you using the smith machine
2012-09-01 10:12:45 Stefano said: I'll have to learn to set it as a rack
2012-09-01 10:12:57 Stefano said: yeah I'll use that
2012-09-01 10:13:08 thootwoops said: take the bar off, move the uprights, put the bar back...
2012-09-01 10:14:32 Stefano said: I'll have to take off the pads
2012-09-01 10:14:38 Stefano said: move the bench

2012-09-01 20:04:59 ferrum said: hold on, I've confused myself. Someone help me.
2012-09-01 20:05:05 Ragu said: what
2012-09-01 20:05:07 ferrum said: gravity is a force
2012-09-01 20:05:24 Ragu said: yes
2012-09-01 20:05:38 ferrum said: if you release two objects from the same height, pulled by the same gravitational force, neglecting air resistance, they will hit the surface of earth at the same time
2012-09-01 20:05:45 Ragu said: yes
2012-09-01 20:05:53 ferrum said: a = F / m
2012-09-01 20:05:58 ferrum said: how can they hit the ground at the same time?
2012-09-01 20:06:08 Ragu said: all objects fall at the same rate
2012-09-01 20:06:09 ferrum said: oh
2012-09-01 20:06:27 ferrum said: yeah, but how? it's saying that you have two objects, m_1 and m_2
2012-09-01 20:06:29 Ragu said: Galileo
2012-09-01 20:06:30 ferrum said: and a_1 = a_2
2012-09-01 20:06:35 ferrum said: but m_1 != m_2
2012-09-01 20:06:37 Ragu said: ferrum
2012-09-01 20:06:38 Ragu said: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C5_dOEyAfk
2012-09-01 20:06:44 ferrum said: Ragu: nah I just figured it out
2012-09-01 20:06:45 Ragu said: it's just the way it is
2012-09-01 20:06:48 ferrum said: F_1 != F_2
2012-09-01 20:07:03 ferrum said: gravity acts on each particle independently, so the force that's applied is proportional to the mass
2012-09-01 20:07:09 ferrum said: got it, back on track, nothing to see here
2012-09-01 20:07:47 Ragu said: mass stays the same
2012-09-01 20:07:50 Ragu said: weight differs
2012-09-01 20:08:00 Ragu said: big weenies
2012-09-01 20:08:04 Ragu said: little weenies
2012-09-01 20:08:31 ferrum said: that's not the right answer :P
2012-09-01 20:08:42 ferrum said: the right answer is that gravity is a force on particles, not on objects
2012-09-01 20:09:07 ferrum said: so if you have two objects composed of o_1 and o_2 particles, respectively, gravity will apply force g*o_1, g*o_2
2012-09-01 20:10:33 Ragu said: the force of gravity is the same for all objects
2012-09-01 20:10:40 Ragu said: not because it acts on only particles
2012-09-01 20:10:41 ferrum said: no, same for all particles
2012-09-01 20:10:47 Ragu said: but because gravity is a constant force
2012-09-01 20:10:57 ferrum said: yes, as opposed to a changing force
2012-09-01 20:11:15 ferrum said: but look, if you have a huge object and a tiny object, the huge object has way more inertia to overcome to get it moving
2012-09-01 20:11:28 ferrum said: if you push both objects, applying equal force, obviously the small one will move but the large one will not
2012-09-01 20:12:12 ferrum said: but objects drop with the same acceleration
2012-09-01 20:12:16 ferrum said: F = ma -> a = F/m
2012-09-01 20:12:30 ferrum said: so if their masses are different but they have the same acceleration, obviously the forces must also not be equal
2012-09-01 20:12:57 ferrum said: therefore the force that gravity applies is proportional to the mass of the object
2012-09-01 20:12:59 Ragu said: the force is multiplied in accordance to the objects mass
2012-09-01 20:13:02 ferrum said: yes, exactly
2012-09-01 20:13:03 Ragu said: i suppose
2012-09-01 20:13:38 Ragu said: ferrum pls
2012-09-01 20:13:49 Ragu said: you are distracting me with all of this thinking
2012-09-01 20:13:58 ferrum said: sry, back to bicep videos with you

2012-09-01 22:03:05 ferrum said: he was lucky he locked the wheels up and slid into it
2012-09-01 22:03:10 ferrum said: otherwise it would have been head-first
2012-09-01 22:03:49 ferrum said: "he panicked and hit the rear brake only"

2012-09-01 22:04:18 Ragu said: he was going too fast
2012-09-01 22:04:33 Ragu said: and tried to brake mid corner
2012-09-01 22:04:36 ferrum said: having an accident when a car doesn't hit you is just stupid
2012-09-01 22:04:43 Ragu said: making his turning radius even smaller
2012-09-01 22:04:55 ferrum said: well he tried to brake only using the rear brake, which doesn't make any sense and no experienced rider would ever do
2012-09-01 22:05:03 ferrum said: then he braked so hard that he locked up the wheel
2012-09-01 22:05:06 ferrum said: ???
2012-09-01 22:05:09 Ragu said: yeah

2012-09-01 22:06:08 ferrum said: I thought it was only me and nhqe
2012-09-01 22:06:09 Ragu said: since last year

2012-09-01 22:06:30 ferrum said: was just about to ask :P
2012-09-01 22:07:31 Ragu said: i lovem ninja 500s
2012-09-01 22:07:38 Ragu said: same design since the 80s
2012-09-01 22:07:38 _VIPPER_ said: same
2012-09-01 22:07:47 Ragu said: perfection
2012-09-01 22:07:56 Ragu said: same
2012-09-01 22:07:56 _VIPPER_ said: same
2012-09-01 22:08:01 ferrum said: Ragu: what happens if you're going 60 with the clutch out, then roll the throttle closed?
2012-09-01 22:08:10 ferrum said: do you just get thrown, or does it slow down gradually?
2012-09-01 22:08:46 Ragu said: if the clutch is disengaged?
2012-09-01 22:08:51 Ragu said: slow down gradually
2012-09-01 22:08:55 Ragu said: theres no resistance
2012-09-01 22:09:03 ferrum said: no, hands are off the clutch
2012-09-01 22:09:08 Ragu said: oh
2012-09-01 22:09:10 ferrum said: full chain engagement
2012-09-01 22:09:10 Ragu said: well then
2012-09-01 22:09:50 Ragu said: assuming you mean just letting go of the throttle at 60 mph
2012-09-01 22:09:53 ferrum said: yes
2012-09-01 22:09:54 Ragu said: without downshifting
2012-09-01 22:09:56 ferrum said: yes
2012-09-01 22:10:05 Ragu said: you would just slow down and eventually stall
2012-09-01 22:10:18 ferrum said: it wouldn't lock up? you wouldn't flip?
2012-09-01 22:10:22 Ragu said: n
2012-09-01 22:10:24 ferrum said: I'm always scared about closing the throttle for that reason
2012-09-01 22:11:01 Ragu said: even if it did
2012-09-01 22:11:09 Ragu said: you could just squeeze the clutch
2012-09-01 22:11:14 Ragu said: and be fine
2012-09-01 22:11:23 ferrum said: depends on how suddenly it locks
2012-09-01 22:11:33 ferrum said: I want to experiment to find it out, but don't want to ruin the bike or anything >_>
2012-09-01 22:12:00 wonderbeaver said: man imagine if irc channels
2012-09-01 22:12:01 wonderbeaver said: were real
2012-09-01 22:12:03 Ragu said: it wouldn;t lock though
2012-09-01 22:12:04 wonderbeaver said: and bots were real
2012-09-01 22:12:12 wonderbeaver said: wouldnt be that awesome actually
2012-09-01 22:12:12 wonderbeaver said: lmfao
2012-09-01 22:12:16 ferrum said: Ragu: yeah, that makes sense.
2012-09-01 22:12:30 ferrum said: Ragu: I mean, when you ride, do you normally touch the clutch outside of shifting?
2012-09-01 22:12:36 Ragu said: you would just slowly lose RPM
2012-09-01 22:12:40 Ragu said: and then stall
2012-09-01 22:12:41 ferrum said: I tend to ride with it always pulled in, then use short bursts of acceleration
2012-09-01 22:13:12 Ragu said: the only way to lock the rear tire without any brake would be to severely downshot at high speeds
2012-09-01 22:13:19 Ragu said: downshift
2012-09-01 22:13:40 Ragu said: like 5th to 2nd or first
2012-09-01 22:13:47 ferrum said: that's how I brake B)
2012-09-01 22:13:51 Ragu said: lol
2012-09-01 22:13:58 ferrum said: doesn't lock up the wheel if you do it right
2012-09-01 22:13:58 Ragu said: not good man
2012-09-01 22:14:03 Ragu said: everyone gets clever
2012-09-01 22:14:04 Ragu said: listen
2012-09-01 22:14:13 Ragu said: new brakes are cheaper than a new transmission
2012-09-01 22:14:17 Ragu said: quit raggin on it
2012-09-01 22:14:26 ferrum said: I was told it doesn't fuck up the engine in the training course
2012-09-01 22:14:33 Ragu said: engine no
2012-09-01 22:14:36 Ragu said: transmission
2012-09-01 22:14:40 Ragu said: certainly gets stressed
2012-09-01 22:14:52 Ragu said: not severely
2012-09-01 22:14:56 Ragu said: but like I said
2012-09-01 22:15:04 Ragu said: might as well wear out the brakes instead
2012-09-01 22:15:23 Ragu said: call me a coocoo bird ferrum
2012-09-01 22:15:31 ferrum said: Ragu: I mean, when you ride, do you normally touch the clutch outside of shifting?

2012-09-01 22:15:44 ferrum said: I tend to ride with it always pulled in, then use short bursts of acceleration
2012-09-01 22:15:46 Ragu said: yes
2012-09-01 22:15:53 Ragu said: whenever I downshoft to come to a stop
2012-09-01 22:15:59 Ragu said: i never let go of the clutch
2012-09-01 22:16:05 ferrum said: yes that's shifting
2012-09-01 22:16:06 Ragu said: shift*
2012-09-01 22:16:17 ferrum said: but like, if you're riding on a local road and you're trying to maintain 30mph
2012-09-01 22:16:19 Ragu said: meaning i don't engage it in between gears to slow
2012-09-01 22:16:22 Ragu said: i just use brakes
2012-09-01 22:16:44 ferrum said: I tend to accelerate to like 35, then hold the clutch in with no throttle, slow down, apply throttle, slow down, apply throttle, etc
2012-09-01 22:16:57 Ragu said: yeah
2012-09-01 22:17:09 ferrum said: but I don't know if this is what I'm supposed to be doing, although it works perfectly well
2012-09-01 22:17:47 Ragu said: I think you are misunderstanding the mechanics of the throttle and transmission/clutch
2012-09-01 22:17:49 ferrum said: would it maybe be more efficient to always have the clutch engaged, and just roll the throttle like that, instead of disengaging?
2012-09-01 22:18:02 Ragu said: you do not have to engage the clutch when you want to let go of the throttle
2012-09-01 22:18:20 ferrum said: ah, that's what I was asking
2012-09-01 22:18:21 ferrum said: ok
2012-09-01 22:18:24 Ragu said: yeah
2012-09-01 22:18:34 ferrum said: but it's more efficient to do so, yes?
2012-09-01 22:18:41 ferrum said: eliminates friction?
2012-09-01 22:18:49 Ragu said: if you just sit yourself down and think about how the whole system works
2012-09-01 22:19:01 Ragu said: it becomes pretty clear what you can and cannot do
2012-09-01 22:19:19 jbb said: so wait
2012-09-01 22:19:21 Ragu said: i suppose it would elliminate friction
2012-09-01 22:19:23 jbb said: is engine braking bad or not
2012-09-01 22:19:23 Ragu said: but i mean
2012-09-01 22:19:28 Ragu said: negligable
2012-09-01 22:19:30 ferrum said: jbb: I was told no by an instructor
2012-09-01 22:19:38 Ragu said: engine braking is bad IMO
2012-09-01 22:19:40 Ragu said: I do not like it
2012-09-01 22:19:47 ferrum said: he told us to engine brake as much as we can get away with to save the brake apads
2012-09-01 22:19:51 ferrum said: pads
2012-09-01 22:19:53 Ragu said: brakes are cheaper than a new transmission jbb
2012-09-01 22:20:05 Ragu said: my goddamn argument
2012-09-01 22:20:15 jbb said: tru
2012-09-01 22:20:32 Ragu said: ferrum unfortunately the majority of people think the whole idea of engine braking is clever and a "trick" you can learn and use
2012-09-01 22:20:37 Ragu said: it's almost novel
2012-09-01 22:20:47 Ragu said: but if you think about it for 10 seconds
2012-09-01 22:20:56 Ragu said: you will reach the point I bring up
2012-09-01 22:21:00 ferrum said: it's not a trick, it's partial engagement of frictional plates
2012-09-01 22:21:08 ferrum said: it's like, it's what the plates do
2012-09-01 22:21:10 Ragu said: that's not what I mean
2012-09-01 22:21:19 Ragu said: I mean people think they are clever for doing it
2012-09-01 22:21:31 jbb said: i always figured unless you redlined it's ok
2012-09-01 22:21:34 Ragu said: and in that sense of cleverness they lose sense of logic
2012-09-01 22:21:43 Ragu said: the logic that brakes are fucking cheaper than transmissions
2012-09-01 22:22:01 Ragu said: it does put stress on the trans
2012-09-01 22:22:14 Ragu said: something has to be stressed for energy to be taken away
2012-09-01 22:22:21 Ragu said: eityher the brakes or trans
2012-09-01 22:22:24 Ragu said: your choice
2012-09-01 22:22:45 jbb said: ill take your word
2012-09-01 22:22:55 jbb said: considering i dont really know how transmissions work
2012-09-01 22:23:03 Ragu said: turn all that kinetic energy into some good old fashioned heat
2012-09-01 22:23:13 Ragu said: use da brakes

2012-09-01 22:23:48 Ragu said: :)
2012-09-01 22:25:39 Ragu said: but ferrum your way of riding by disengaging the clutch when relasing the throttle isn't wrong btw
2012-09-01 22:25:55 ferrum said: well I'm doing that because I was afraid I'd die if I didn't B)
2012-09-01 22:25:55 Ragu said: in fact it's a little bit better to do that for the trans sake
2012-09-01 22:25:58 Ragu said: lol
2012-09-01 22:26:07 Ragu said: but it's not neccessary

2012-09-04 12:33:09 frogprince_mac said: rustles my jimmies
2012-09-04 12:34:39 Blice said: ferrum: I only have experience with posix compilers
2012-09-04 12:34:53 ferrum said: me too
2012-09-04 12:35:01 ferrum said: because they don't suck shit
2012-09-04 12:35:07 Blice said: well
2012-09-04 12:35:12 Blice said: then again microsoft's C compiler produces faster code
2012-09-04 12:35:12 ferrum said: try to get a packed struct with MSVC++
2012-09-04 12:35:15 Blice said: so who am I to judge
2012-09-04 12:35:19 Blice said: I just have no use for compiling on windows
2012-09-04 12:35:23 ferrum said: I dare you, I double-dare you motherfucker try to get a packed struct just one goddamn time
2012-09-04 12:35:36 Blice said: why would getting a packed struct be an issue?
2012-09-04 12:35:42 Blice said: what does MSVC++ do?
2012-09-04 12:35:47 ferrum said: Win64 doesn't align things like you think it does
2012-09-04 12:35:53 ferrum said: Windows also actually
2012-09-04 12:36:00 oatzhakok said: that sucks
2012-09-04 12:36:08 oatzhakok said: but isn't struct packing compiler defined?
2012-09-04 12:36:22 ferrum said: yes, but the way they've defined it is fucking annoying as shit
2012-09-04 12:36:35 oatzhakok said: well
2012-09-04 12:36:36 ferrum said: you have to use PRAGMA PACKED all over the place
2012-09-04 12:36:40 oatzhakok said: yeah
2012-09-04 12:36:43 oatzhakok said: yay windoze
2012-09-04 12:55:09 Blice said: so ferrum, I had an idea
2012-09-04 12:55:13 Blice said: about your programming/TM
2012-09-04 12:55:53 Blice said: came to me while reading about advanced programs
2012-09-04 12:56:19 Blice said: you know how advanced programs typically, at least if they are in the Rippetoe/Kilgore model, do some sort of volume-recovery-intensity cycle of the course of a month
2012-09-04 12:56:39 Blice said: I was thinking about advanced novice where you take a light day inbetween PRs for awhile before you go into TM
2012-09-04 12:56:47 Blice said: the same might work for an intermediate,
2012-09-04 12:56:53 Blice said: taking a recovery week inbetween PR weeks
2012-09-04 12:57:14 Blice said: eg, drop weights 20% for a week, normal TM week, 20% week again, normal week, so on
2012-09-04 12:57:20 Blice said: what do you think?
2012-09-04 12:57:22 oatzhakok said: from what i've been talking to the more experienced lifters in my new gym
2012-09-04 12:57:48 oatzhakok said: technical lifts (snatch and clean and jerk) need like 3 weeks
2012-09-04 12:57:51 oatzhakok said: to see strength gains
2012-09-04 12:58:23 Blice said: oatzhakok: at what level?
2012-09-04 12:58:29 Blice said: intermediate?
2012-09-04 12:58:31 oatzhakok said: any level
2012-09-04 12:58:37 Blice said: uh
2012-09-04 12:58:44 oatzhakok said: they were advising me to try for PRs every 3 or so weeks
2012-09-04 12:58:54 Blice said: a novice recovers faster than someone who's been training for 5 years
2012-09-04 12:58:56 oatzhakok said: but those two lifts are very technical
2012-09-04 12:59:01 oatzhakok said: Blice: not about recovery
2012-09-04 12:59:11 oatzhakok said: about strength gains coming from changes in technique
2012-09-04 12:59:17 oatzhakok said: as the oly lifter progresses
2012-09-04 12:59:22 oatzhakok said: his techiques does as well
2012-09-04 12:59:32 oatzhakok said: and you need time for the new muscles to develop
2012-09-04 13:00:10 Blice said: new muscle developing is part of recovery
2012-09-04 13:00:25 Blice said: anyway in the classical periodization system PRing every 3 weeks would be considered an advanced program
2012-09-04 13:00:27 Raggles said: shut
2012-09-04 13:00:28 Raggles said: up
2012-09-04 13:00:49 Blice said: and besides national competitors sometimes still do linear progression weekly,
2012-09-04 13:00:50 oatzhakok said: blice
2012-09-04 13:00:52 Blice said: like jon north
2012-09-04 13:00:58 oatzhakok said: oly lifts are not like squats
2012-09-04 13:01:06 ferrum said: Blice: yes that is what I did before switching to TM, lifted heavy monday/friday
2012-09-04 13:01:13 oatzhakok said: i would take the advice of national level lifters over you
2012-09-04 13:01:14 oatzhakok said: sry bro
2012-09-04 13:01:15 oatzhakok said: ;-;
2012-09-04 13:01:17 Blice said: ferrum: so the idea is to take a deload week inbetween TM weeks
2012-09-04 13:01:21 ferrum said: why
2012-09-04 13:01:39 ferrum said: what problem is being solved here
2012-09-04 13:01:39 Blice said: for the same reason you start taking a rest day between monday and friday
2012-09-04 13:02:03 Blice said: I'm saying it might be a good middle step between TM and an advanced program
2012-09-04 13:02:12 Blice said: if you're coming to an end of intermediate gains
2012-09-04 13:02:17 ferrum said: probably not, if I take a week off my lifts suck shit
2012-09-04 13:02:22 Blice said: not off, 20%,
2012-09-04 13:02:26 ferrum said: 20% is off
2012-09-04 13:02:40 ferrum said: 20% is a nice stroll in the park with my bonnet and crumpets
2012-09-04 13:03:07 Blice said: I googled it and my idea is already done
2012-09-04 13:03:14 Blice said: "TM deload week", go
2012-09-04 13:03:37 ferrum said: I wouldn't do things unless you think they're actually necessary to solve a problem you're having
2012-09-04 13:03:50 ferrum said: and only then when the problem actually presents itself
2012-09-04 13:04:16 Blice said: I thought you said you were failing lifts
2012-09-04 13:04:17 Blice said: sorry
2012-09-04 13:04:21 ferrum said: OHP yes :P
2012-09-04 13:04:25 Blice said: squats
2012-09-04 13:04:27 Blice said: last few weeks
2012-09-04 13:04:39 ferrum said: that's what happens when I get the bright idea to stop doing 5RMs, yes
2012-09-04 13:04:50 Blice said: I thought you had a bright idea because you were failing lifts
2012-09-04 13:04:50 Blice said: U:
2012-09-04 13:05:00 Raggles said: man
2012-09-04 13:05:05 Raggles said: shut the fuck up
2012-09-04 13:05:06 ferrum said: sometimes you fail lifts
2012-09-04 13:05:06 Blice said: I think PP mentioned planned deloads too btw
2012-09-04 13:05:09 ferrum said: shit happens
2012-09-04 13:05:13 ferrum said: planned parenthood?
2012-09-04 13:05:20 Blice said: practical programming
2012-09-04 13:05:41 Blice said: k ill shut up
2012-09-04 13:05:55 ferrum said: I mean, I failed, I tried 3RMs and that didn't work, I reset
2012-09-04 13:06:09 ferrum said: the lifts I'm doing now feel way easier than before the reset, and I'm only 5lbs below weight that felt like death
2012-09-04 13:06:12 ferrum said: so clearly it's positive
2012-09-04 13:08:34 Blice said: found what rippetoe says aout it on the forums
2012-09-04 13:08:36 Blice said: seems simple,
2012-09-04 13:08:39 Blice said: "If and when you get stuck, just take a light week. But don't plan it until it happens, and when it does, just take a light week. You know, back off quite a bit for the week." - rip
2012-09-04 13:08:49 Blice said: so I guess no to 'planned' deloads
2012-09-04 13:09:34 ferrum said: or maybe yes, he's not god, logic your way through to the other side
2012-09-04 13:10:54 Blice said: ferrum: ill see when I get there I guess
2012-09-04 13:11:09 ferrum said: in my experience if I take a light week, my lifts regress
2012-09-04 13:15:01 BradPitt said: for serious?
2012-09-04 13:15:12 BradPitt said: if i take a light week i usually hit PRs after

2012-09-04 13:39:08 Bucketphase said: anyway
2012-09-04 13:40:02 Bucketphase said: BradPitt, the guy on the motorcycle got nudge by a car and he went into the guard rail and his handlebar/front tyre was stuck and he was smashing into the guardrail repeatedly at like 80km/h for a hundred feet or osmething
2012-09-04 13:40:03 Bucketphase said: and then
2012-09-04 13:40:09 Bucketphase said: he fell off into the middle of the road

2012-09-04 13:40:44 Bucketphase said: so he moved so funnily
2012-09-04 13:40:45 BradPitt said: what do you mean he was continually smashing into the guardrail?

2012-09-04 13:41:11 Bucketphase said: some part of his bike got stuck into the thing in the middle of the motorway that prevents cars from swerving into the lane in the opposite direction
2012-09-04 13:41:20 thootwoops said: although it seems like it would work for that too
2012-09-04 13:41:50 Bucketphase said: so he was getting pummelled against this metal shit with poles and other shit
2012-09-04 13:41:54 Bucketphase said: and in the end all his joints were rearranged

2012-09-05 13:08:38 frogprince_mac said: thats impossible hurr
2012-09-05 13:08:43 Blice said: knees out isn't so that the knee tracks over the foot
2012-09-05 13:09:00 Blice said: it does track over the foot
2012-09-05 13:09:11 Blice said: but the main reason for knees out is to avoid hip inpingment
2012-09-05 13:09:16 Blice said: and shit getting in the way causing buttwink
2012-09-05 13:10:19 Blice said: and so feet more forward (but not FORWARD) is supposed to even out the muscle distribution through your thigh, said someone who knows more about anatomy than I do and said a lot of shit I don't understand to make that point
2012-09-05 13:10:42 Blice said: but he goes on to say to only play with that if you have the ankle mobility to do it because if you don't then you're going to fuck your shit up

2012-09-05 14:49:09 ferrum said: Every great blog needs a great tagline. I am sure the JavaScript team can do better than "Just another blog.mozilla.org site." To that end I invite the team to submit tagline suggestions to me. I will compile the list of all entries received by next Wednesday (Sept 5th) and setup some sort of rank voting (Condorcet alg) to elect a winner. Let the creative flood begin! :)
2012-09-05 14:49:14 ferrum said: There will be more on the JS blog to come. Until then please don't hesitate to reach out if you have a post you wish to contribute.

2012-09-05 16:11:27 ferrum said: President Barack Obama himself intervened regarding the Jerusalem language, a senior Democratic source told CNN, adding, that he thought the original draft was "a strong statement and he didn't want there to be any confusion about his unshakeable commitment to the security of state israel. The issue of the day is Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah."
2012-09-05 16:11:32 ferrum said: "I am here to attest and affirm that our faith and belief in God is central to the American story and informs the values we've expressed in our party's platform," Strickland, who chaired the party's platform committee, read. "In addition, President Obama recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and our party's platform should as well."

2012-09-06 01:15:51 Ragu said: idk
2012-09-06 01:15:52 Ragu said: the new lumia looks so good
2012-09-06 01:15:54 Ragu said: might get one
2012-09-06 01:16:02 ferrum said: facebook is also making a phone
2012-09-06 01:16:06 ferrum said: although it's top-secret
2012-09-06 01:16:19 ferrum said: it's the cool thing to do these days I guess
2012-09-06 01:16:27 ferrum said: at least mozilla has a reason to make one, I don't get these others
2012-09-06 01:16:33 ferrum said: marketshare grab I guess
2012-09-06 01:17:21 Ragu said: a facebook phone
2012-09-06 01:17:39 ferrum said: facebook integration with everything :D
2012-09-06 01:17:51 ferrum said: apps direct from the Facebook App Store :D
2012-09-06 01:17:54 Ragu said: they must be scrambling to make themselves more appealing after that whole going public disaster
2012-09-06 01:17:56 ferrum said: because you really use that
2012-09-06 01:18:04 ferrum said: well, they're kind of fucked
2012-09-06 01:18:21 ferrum said: because they wrote in their IPO that their continued competitiveness is contingent upon performance in the mobile sector
2012-09-06 01:18:34 ferrum said: and they haven't done anything other than rewrite their app to not be utterly useless
2012-09-06 01:18:47 ferrum said: facebook needs bundling deals
2012-09-06 01:18:54 ferrum said: dropbox also, actually
2012-09-06 01:18:58 Ragu said: how can you have something so popular
2012-09-06 01:19:06 Ragu said: and be complete shit at the same time
2012-09-06 01:19:26 Ragu said: how do you fuck that up
2012-09-06 01:19:26 ferrum said: try to think about how you'd monetize facebook
2012-09-06 01:19:36 ferrum said: you can't sell user data because user data is the only reason you have your monopoly
2012-09-06 01:19:53 Ragu said: ads aren't enough
2012-09-06 01:19:57 ferrum said: you can't sell good ads, because people go on the site to chat with and look up stuff about their friends
2012-09-06 01:19:58 Ragu said: targeted adds at that
2012-09-06 01:20:15 ferrum said: whereas with google, they serve ads to people actively looking for things, and the ads are often helpful and welcome
2012-09-06 01:21:08 ferrum said: the current business plan appears to be "sell ads and pretend like they're working", but recently a good portion of large-sized companies have announced that they actually did measurements and FB ads have horrible ROI
2012-09-06 01:21:22 Ragu said: yeah
2012-09-06 01:22:15 Ragu said: I think companies would rather just setup their own page
2012-09-06 01:22:16 Ragu said: for free
2012-09-06 01:22:28 Ragu said: they should think about taxing that
2012-09-06 01:22:37 Ragu said: charging a fee for business pages
2012-09-06 01:22:44 ferrum said: well, facebook has done a really good job at convincing companies that "Likes" actually matter, and that having a page on FB is better than having a non-FB URL
2012-09-06 01:23:35 Ragu said: so zuckerburg createa an algorithm to add x amount of likes from random people accounts
2012-09-06 01:23:38 ferrum said: that's how Yellow Book makes its money, it's reasonable
2012-09-06 01:23:39 Ragu said: creates*
2012-09-06 01:23:43 ferrum said: yeah, you just go and buy Likes
2012-09-06 01:23:48 ferrum said: tons of people are selling them online
2012-09-06 01:23:48 Ragu said: and it down't notify those users
2012-09-06 01:23:59 BradPitt said: they are the best marketing platform atm
2012-09-06 01:23:59 ferrum said: it's actually pretty expensive
2012-09-06 01:24:00 BradPitt said: probably ever
2012-09-06 01:24:21 ferrum said: twitter?
2012-09-06 01:24:24 BradPitt said: the way "x friend liked a page" is genius
2012-09-06 01:24:27 Ragu said: so why isn't facebook charging for business pages
2012-09-06 01:24:35 Ragu said: instead of sidebar ads
2012-09-06 01:24:36 BradPitt said: increases the net reach by SO much
2012-09-06 01:24:55 BradPitt said: but yeah a lot of fb clicks come from bots
2012-09-06 01:25:01 Ragu said: if I'm not mistaken it's completely free to start a group page or whatever
2012-09-06 01:25:42 ferrum said: BradPitt: it's slightly different in that Google gives really good, detailed, explicit data about how your marketing campaign is performing
2012-09-06 01:25:53 ferrum said: click-through rates to your site, etc., very extensive analysis
2012-09-06 01:26:09 ferrum said: if you do a marketing campaign on some FB company page it's not measurable
2012-09-06 01:26:12 Ragu said: the amount of time people spend on your site
2012-09-06 01:27:14 ferrum said: yeah, because they also have code running on your site
2012-09-06 01:27:25 ferrum said: can collect whatever data from people
2012-09-06 01:27:33 ferrum said: FB won't do that
2012-09-06 01:27:35 BradPitt said: it is measurable
2012-09-06 01:27:37 Ragu said: I'm surprised they haven't rolled out some kind of "facebook premium account"
2012-09-06 01:27:37 BradPitt said: with your own metrics
2012-09-06 01:27:39 ferrum said: but I'll tell you, Chris Ronan weren't that way
2012-09-06 01:27:43 ferrum said: Chris Ronan was a motherfucker
2012-09-06 01:27:58 ferrum said: 4chan gold account
2012-09-06 01:28:24 Ragu said: do you know how many people owuld buy a 4chan gold account if it existed
2012-09-06 01:28:27 ferrum said: BradPitt: small companies aren't going to write their own metrics software, and they don't want to buy metrics software
2012-09-06 01:28:41 ferrum said: 4chan should work like SA
2012-09-06 01:28:55 ferrum said: I should be able to pay $10 to put SHITCUNT FUCKLICKER next to Aguadito's trip every time he posts
2012-09-06 01:28:58 BradPitt said: 4chan should work like it currently does
2012-09-06 01:28:59 Ragu said: metrics should be provoded by the goddamn provider
2012-09-06 01:29:10 BradPitt said: except hellbanning should be added
2012-09-06 01:29:10 Ragu said: ided
2012-09-06 01:29:30 ferrum said: I really like the new 4chan update btw

2012-09-06 01:30:31 BradPitt said: wonder how they did that
2012-09-06 01:30:37 BradPitt said: computer imaging + xy axis
2012-09-06 01:30:38 BradPitt said: but like fuck

2012-09-06 01:32:45 BradPitt said: but like
2012-09-06 01:32:50 BradPitt said: god damn that must have taken a long time
2012-09-06 01:33:34 Ragu said: is this just a demonstration
2012-09-06 01:33:41 BradPitt said: idk
2012-09-06 01:33:42 Ragu said: idgi at all
2012-09-06 01:34:03 ferrum said: I broke it
2012-09-06 01:34:04 Ragu said: what's the application
2012-09-06 01:34:51 BradPitt said: there is no practical component
2012-09-06 01:34:54 ferrum said: oh it's using... the... FB API
2012-09-06 01:34:55 BradPitt said: just POC
2012-09-06 01:34:57 ferrum said: it's not even clever
2012-09-06 01:35:33 Ragu said: and why is it taking 10 seconds to load a jpeg in the KBs
2012-09-06 01:35:40 Ragu said: BradPitt pls
2012-09-06 01:36:03 BradPitt said: because it has to scan the canvas for the mouse
2012-09-06 01:36:11 BradPitt said: then search for an image in the db with those coordinates
2012-09-06 01:36:13 BradPitt said: then load it
2012-09-06 01:36:52 BradPitt said: oh its gay jquery

2012-09-06 01:37:37 ferrum said: it has to call two functions?
2012-09-06 01:37:49 BradPitt said: also there are only a few images
2012-09-06 01:38:01 BradPitt said: so its pre-determined by little groups of pixels
2012-09-06 01:38:06 BradPitt said: like 10x10 it seems
2012-09-06 01:38:11 ferrum said: what I'm learning from this page is that average americans are fucking ugly

2012-09-06 01:44:42 BradPitt said: I had some success using the device My experience was that consecutive sets of work felt like the first if the device was use for 3 - 5 minutes before the set. I also noticed that I could perform a larger volume of work: more weight for more reps and sets. A longer duration recovery period after whatever work seemed to improve immediate recovery
2012-09-06 01:44:46 BradPitt said: brb building and setting PRs daily
2012-09-06 01:47:41 BradPitt said: "No trollin I actually have used one of these before and I have also done a cycle.I can honestly say that when lifting I felt the same using this when I did my cycle.I was able to crank out a ridiculous amount of reps and continuously add weight. I actually rigged something up kinda like it lol it basically creates suction causing my veins to come to pop out on my palms

2012-09-06 12:09:39 ferrum said: probably won't get it finished this week, but I'll get close.
2012-09-06 12:09:42 ferrum said: yeah, I'm building one.

2012-09-06 12:10:32 BradPitt said: or epoxy
2012-09-06 12:10:49 ferrum said: the design online just requires you to keep pumping to maintain the vaccum
2012-09-06 12:10:51 ferrum said: vacuum
2012-09-06 12:11:02 ferrum said: which isn't unreasonable

2012-09-06 12:11:52 oatzhakok said: what's the tl;dr?
2012-09-06 12:11:52 ferrum said: the bench one was a guy with a 255 1RM, who did 4 sets of 85% to failure, 3 mins rest in between
2012-09-06 12:12:17 Bucketecaf said: and what happened
2012-09-06 12:12:34 ferrum said: oatzhakok: three observations:
2012-09-06 12:12:50 oatzhakok said: word tyvm
2012-09-06 12:12:54 ferrum said: 1) your palms/feet/face have special blood vessels designed to dissipate whole-body heat, not found anywhere else on the body
2012-09-06 12:13:43 ferrum said: 2) temperature is used by your body as a signal to produce lactic acid, causing muscle fatigue, preventing you from over-exerting. So if the temperature is regulated you won't get fatigued.
2012-09-06 12:14:17 ferrum said: actually just those two
2012-09-06 12:14:35 ferrum said: then they have you hold a conductive surface (copper / aluminum), and pump cold water through it.
2012-09-06 12:15:14 ferrum said: unfortunately that doesn't work because that causes your blood vessels to constrict, so they also put your hand in a sealed vacuum chamber with ~3 in.HG, causing your blood vessels to come closer to the surface and not constrict.

2012-09-06 12:15:53 ferrum said: I might have the lactic acid part wrong, but that seems to be the principle of the thing regardless of mechanism
2012-09-06 12:16:09 Blice said: is getting your body physically warm before a workout counter productive then?
2012-09-06 12:16:12 oatzhakok said: ok
2012-09-06 12:16:14 oatzhakok said: huh
2012-09-06 12:16:17 oatzhakok said: so it isn't comparable to steroids
2012-09-06 12:16:19 oatzhakok said: it just make you recover faster
2012-09-06 12:16:22 oatzhakok said: still rad as hell if it's true
2012-09-06 12:16:24 oatzhakok said: you plan to test it scientifically at all?
2012-09-06 12:16:27 Bucketecaf said: it doesnt do anything
2012-09-06 12:16:46 ferrum said: oatzhakok: specifically it was saying that recovery with this between-sets is comparable to recovery with steroids, and it has no downsides like steroids have
2012-09-06 12:17:01 ferrum said: steroids obviously function more than just between-sets
2012-09-06 12:17:05 oatzhakok said: oh ok
2012-09-06 12:17:06 oatzhakok said: right

2012-09-06 14:00:06 ferrum said: I think the best way to build it is to buy 2 of the rubber PVC caps and make sure that the vacuum is stable without the glove
2012-09-06 14:00:28 x4nti said: lmao
2012-09-06 14:00:41 Number1Stunna said: are you making a pipe bomb?

2012-09-06 14:04:20 nhqe said: no it isn't
2012-09-06 14:04:40 Number1Stunna said: the temp of the water is the most important thing
2012-09-06 14:04:53 Number1Stunna said: it has to not be cold enough to make the blood vessels significantly like
2012-09-06 14:04:54 ferrum said: I'll experiment with the variables
2012-09-06 14:04:57 Number1Stunna said: decrease in size or whatever
2012-09-06 14:05:04 BradPitt said: ...to remove heat
2012-09-06 14:05:10 Number1Stunna said: that's why regular ice doesn't work
2012-09-06 14:05:14 BradPitt said: wrong
2012-09-06 14:05:22 BradPitt said: ice contricts blood vessel flow
2012-09-06 14:05:24 Number1Stunna said: you probably didn't even read the article, bp
2012-09-06 14:05:25 Number1Stunna said: yeah

2012-09-06 14:05:37 BradPitt said: thats the reason for the vacuum
2012-09-06 14:05:46 Number1Stunna said: evidently you don't read anything
2012-09-06 14:05:48 BradPitt said: to bring the blood vessels to the hands constantly
2012-09-06 14:06:00 Number1Stunna said: you probably got one of those diabetes meters that talks to you
2012-09-06 14:06:06 Number1Stunna said: since you wouldn't even read that!
2012-09-06 14:06:09 ferrum said: I wonder how I'm going to transport this thing to the gym with an already-full motorcycle

2012-09-06 14:09:04 Stefano said: people will start curling the glove
2012-09-06 14:09:04 ferrum said: if they have 12" girth yes

2012-09-06 14:09:40 Number1Stunna said: i bet it would feel good since it's a vacuum
2012-09-06 14:10:08 Stefano said: those some whiteprints of something that
2012-09-06 14:10:11 Stefano said: pumps beer in your dick
2012-09-06 14:10:14 Stefano said: definitely
2012-09-06 14:10:35 x4nti said: uhm
2012-09-06 14:10:53 x4nti said: i dont understand why you can just cool the entire body?
2012-09-06 14:11:06 Number1Stunna said: because the entire body isn't efficient for that
2012-09-06 14:11:13 Number1Stunna said: only certain surfaces with special blood vessels
2012-09-06 14:11:17 Number1Stunna said: like those in human hands & human feet
2012-09-06 14:11:23 Number1Stunna said: http://i.imgur.com/nh0Y3.jpg
2012-09-06 14:11:24 x4nti said: ofcourse it is, more surface area means more cooling?√Ö
2012-09-06 14:11:27 Number1Stunna said: no
2012-09-06 14:11:34 Number1Stunna said: those blood vessels are only in the hands & feet
2012-09-06 14:11:36 ferrum said: x4nti: the claim is that heat dissipators exist in the palms, and it's more effective to cool them than to cool anything else
2012-09-06 14:11:39 Number1Stunna said: you could wear two gloves
2012-09-06 14:11:42 Number1Stunna said: and two boots
2012-09-06 14:11:43 Number1Stunna said: to do it
2012-09-06 14:11:48 Number1Stunna said: but why
2012-09-06 14:11:49 Stefano said: so the best would be having two gloves
2012-09-06 14:11:49 ferrum said: and a cap, head is also a dissipator
2012-09-06 14:11:55 x4nti said: ferrum: sounds ridiculous
2012-09-06 14:12:00 Number1Stunna said: there's hair on the head though
2012-09-06 14:12:02 ferrum said: x4nti: sounds like mad natty gainz bruh
2012-09-06 14:12:03 Number1Stunna said: you'd have to shave your head
2012-09-06 14:12:18 Number1Stunna said: plus it's probably bad if your brain gets cold
2012-09-06 14:12:34 Stefano said: cryoliposis in your hand
2012-09-06 14:12:44 x4nti said: why not just take a bath in water of the desired temperature?
2012-09-06 14:13:00 Stefano said: doesn't it suck air or something
2012-09-06 14:13:06 ferrum said: x4nti: because that's hard to do between squat sets
2012-09-06 14:13:10 ferrum said: @_@
2012-09-06 14:13:20 x4nti said: so you're supposed to use it during training?
2012-09-06 14:13:23 ferrum said: yes, between sets
2012-09-06 14:13:33 x4nti said: i thought it was while recovering from training..
2012-09-06 14:13:36 ferrum said: no
2012-09-06 14:13:36 x4nti said: but ok.
2012-09-06 14:13:51 Blice said: its a specific temp, right ferrum?
2012-09-06 14:13:59 Number1Stunna said: recovering as in between sets
2012-09-06 14:14:04 ferrum said: they tested a bunch, 10C is their current recommendation for aerobic stuff
2012-09-06 14:14:13 ferrum said: 16C is also apparently fine
2012-09-06 14:14:14 Number1Stunna said: but you lift weights
2012-09-06 14:14:18 Number1Stunna said: you don't do jazzercise
2012-09-06 14:14:20 Number1Stunna said: or do you?
2012-09-06 14:14:22 Blice said: I have a squat rack in my office at home... maybe I can try loading the bathtub up with ice to a specific temp and then sit in it for a bit
2012-09-06 14:14:22 ferrum said: I zumba
2012-09-06 14:14:27 Blice said: and then go squat
2012-09-06 14:14:28 Blice said: (naked)
2012-09-06 14:14:34 Blice said: w
2012-09-06 14:14:34 _VIPPER_ said: wwwwwwwwwwwwwww
2012-09-06 14:14:37 Number1Stunna said: just hold ice in your hand
2012-09-06 14:14:51 Blice said: Number1Stunna do you even tone glove?
2012-09-06 14:14:51 ferrum said: when Blice comes here he can try the glove, assuming I solved the problems by then
2012-09-06 14:15:06 Blice said: ferrum: that'll be on the 20 something pls b ready
2012-09-06 14:15:12 Blice said: somethingth*
2012-09-06 14:15:13 ferrum said: 9/20?
2012-09-06 14:15:17 Number1Stunna said: you guys can take turns sticking your dicks in your homemade fleshlight
2012-09-06 14:15:19 Blice said: 20 somethingth
2012-09-06 14:15:24 ferrum said: k
2012-09-06 14:15:42 Blice said: Number1Stunna: why would I put my dick in a homemade fleshlight if I have ferrum ?
2012-09-06 14:15:45 Blice said: no homo
2012-09-06 14:15:59 ferrum said: a guy at the gym winked at me yesterday
2012-09-06 14:16:03 ferrum said: a very long, very slow wink
2012-09-06 14:16:09 Blice said: that's weird
2012-09-06 14:16:14 Stefano said: was it after he saw you swat ATG
2012-09-06 14:16:24 ferrum said: it was after he saw me picking up motorcycle gear
2012-09-06 14:16:55 Number1Stunna said: told you, ferrum

2012-09-06 14:44:00 ferrum said: how much does putting a 90 degree angle in a pipe affect water pressure?
2012-09-06 14:44:04 ferrum said: probably quite a bit, no?
2012-09-06 14:44:34 Blice said: none
2012-09-06 14:44:49 ferrum said: can't be none
2012-09-06 14:44:58 Blice said: if one end is pushing some psi
2012-09-06 14:45:02 Blice said: the other end would get the same pressure
2012-09-06 14:45:17 ferrum said: don't think so, the water has to actually travel
2012-09-06 14:45:28 Blice said: unless the pipe got smaller
2012-09-06 14:45:33 ferrum said: nope same width
2012-09-06 14:45:40 Blice said: should be the same pressure
2012-09-06 14:46:28 Raggles said: unless the 90degree albow aims the water up
2012-09-06 14:46:34 Raggles said: and against gravity
2012-09-06 14:46:41 ferrum said: the water is always going up
2012-09-06 14:46:46 Raggles said: the difference in pressure will be negligable
2012-09-06 14:46:51 ferrum said: alright cool

2012-09-06 15:00:03 BradPitt said: no i just slash at a nigga
2012-09-06 15:00:09 ferrum said: BradPitt: in the upper-left corner of the room there's an open door, go through it
2012-09-06 15:00:15 ferrum said: you're not supposed to fight the boss the first time you see him
2012-09-06 15:00:18 ferrum said: welcome to dark souls
2012-09-06 15:00:23 BradPitt said: i-i know...
2012-09-06 15:00:26 BradPitt said: this is afterwards

2012-09-06 15:00:31 BradPitt said: ;_;
2012-09-06 15:00:35 ferrum said: so then you jump on his head and do a smash attack from above
2012-09-06 15:00:38 ferrum said: that leaves him at half HP
2012-09-06 15:00:39 BradPitt said: oh
2012-09-06 15:00:40 BradPitt said: fuck
2012-09-06 15:00:45 ferrum said: then you go as close as you can to him

2012-09-06 15:05:11 ferrum said: in general, the way to beat bosses in dark souls is to get high stamina, a good shield, and hug them as closely as you can
2012-09-06 15:05:16 ferrum said: most of them don't hit you if you're right next to them
2012-09-06 15:05:19 ferrum said: but if they do, you're dead

2012-09-06 15:26:15 wonderbeaver said: ferrum what would u suggest then
2012-09-06 15:26:16 wonderbeaver said: python ?
2012-09-06 15:26:23 ferrum said: no, C# is fine
2012-09-06 15:27:29 wonderbeaver said: Straight off the bat, I knew Python was unsuitable. While the language make it easy to pump out code at a ridiculous pace, it is terrifically slow (unless you write a library in C ñ but then thatís C, not Python).
2012-09-06 15:27:43 ferrum said: python is fine, but it's not good to learn in
2012-09-06 15:28:04 ferrum said: better than Java at least
2012-09-06 15:28:45 BradPitt said: i think python is a bad language
2012-09-06 15:28:53 BradPitt said: to learn first*

2012-09-06 15:29:13 ferrum said: you'd think that
2012-09-06 15:29:23 BradPitt said: start with C, Java or C++

2012-09-06 15:39:58 ferrum said: I expect it to work for squats
2012-09-06 15:40:03 ferrum said: if it doesn't, it will at least work for DDR
2012-09-06 15:40:10 Raggles said: it will work
2012-09-06 15:40:16 Raggles said: it's already been proven
2012-09-06 15:40:29 ferrum said: well they're using a thermal regulator and shit :P
2012-09-06 15:40:35 ferrum said: this is a bucket of ice and a squeeze nozzle
2012-09-06 15:41:02 Raggles said: Room for Improvement
2012-09-06 15:41:02 Raggles said: There are definitely ways to make this better.
2012-09-06 15:41:02 Raggles said:  Larger vacuum chamber
2012-09-06 15:41:02 Raggles said:  Increase heat transfer by using a copper pipe, larger pipe or metal dish shape.
2012-09-06 15:41:02 Raggles said:  Box rig for portability
2012-09-06 15:41:03 Raggles said:  Some sort of twist lock for the arm seal
2012-09-06 15:41:06 Raggles said: definitely use copper
2012-09-06 15:41:12 ferrum said: yes using copper
2012-09-06 15:41:17 Raggles said: ok
2012-09-06 15:41:41 ferrum said: don't see why a larger vacuum chamber would help, although I guess I'll figure it out when I try to stuff my hand into the pipe
2012-09-06 15:42:21 beaver said: fuck

2012-09-06 16:19:11 ferrum said: alright, made a list of shit to get at home depot and autozone
2012-09-06 16:19:13 ferrum said: they close at 10
2012-09-06 16:19:28 ferrum said: probably don't have the drill pieces at home either, sigh.
2012-09-06 16:20:37 Number1Stunna said: better just give up!
2012-09-06 16:23:18 ferrum said: nah I'll throw money at the problem
2012-09-06 16:23:31 ferrum said: I'm a bit confused as to how this guy just screws things into PVC
2012-09-06 16:23:41 Blice said: ferrum: do you use a stretch reflex out of the bottom of your presses or do you pause?
2012-09-06 16:23:46 ferrum said: can you just screw it, and the threads will form?
2012-09-06 16:23:49 ferrum said: Blice: stretch
2012-09-06 16:24:15 Blice said: ive been doing pause just to get a breath between reps, I'll try it next time with a breath at the top
2012-09-06 16:25:47 ferrum said: bottom is the hardest part, holding it there is not productive
2012-09-06 16:25:55 ferrum said: with my proportions it doesn't sit nicely against the chest
2012-09-06 16:26:23 Blice said: yeah I can imagine I could do more with the stretch reflex.. I will test this theory Sunday!
2012-09-06 16:27:56 Number1Stunna said: yeah i guess that's how it works, ferrum
2012-09-06 16:28:03 Number1Stunna said: i've never screwed something into pvc
2012-09-06 16:28:10 Number1Stunna said: but it looks like he uses that uh
2012-09-06 16:28:15 Number1Stunna said: like plumber tape? or whatever it's called
2012-09-06 16:28:24 ferrum said: Teflon Thread Seal Tape
2012-09-06 16:28:34 Number1Stunna said: yeah & the PVC is pretty thick
2012-09-06 16:28:39 Number1Stunna said: so i guess maybe that would work
2012-09-06 16:28:44 ferrum said: I am all spec'd out
2012-09-06 16:28:46 Number1Stunna said: probably not the most secure way to do it
2012-09-06 16:28:49 Number1Stunna said: but if it works!
2012-09-06 16:29:37 Number1Stunna said: wait that thing gets drilled all the way through the pipe
2012-09-06 16:29:50 ferrum said: that's the nipple
2012-09-06 16:29:51 Number1Stunna said: i guess that little valve looking thing is just to make the hole the right size
2012-09-06 16:30:29 Number1Stunna said: what if those instructions are actually to make a pipe bomb
2012-09-06 16:30:35 Number1Stunna said: and you blow your hands off?
2012-09-06 16:30:39 ferrum said: :O
2012-09-06 16:31:00 ferrum said: well I'm changing the instructions slightly, I want a bigger pipe

2012-09-06 16:48:03 RagTheTank said: How is the pump coming ferrum
2012-09-06 16:48:41 ferrum said: already .5" increase in width AND girth
2012-09-06 16:49:21 RagTheTank said: Incredible
2012-09-06 16:53:27 RagTheTank said: ferrum less than an hour ago I finished a half gallon if milk

2012-09-06 16:53:44 RagTheTank said: How long do I have
2012-09-06 16:54:42 ferrum said: about 40-60 years I think
2012-09-06 16:59:38 ferrum said: alright called autozone, they have the pump kit
2012-09-06 16:59:40 beaver said: HOW DARE YOU IMPLICATE THOSE IMPLICATIONS

2012-09-06 17:01:32 ferrum said: 7000 is what I ride at on local roads xD
2012-09-06 17:01:40 RagTheTank said: 6th gear
2012-09-06 17:01:46 ferrum said: yes, 7000 and 6th is like 50mph
2012-09-06 17:01:53 RagTheTank said: ;)
2012-09-06 17:02:14 RagTheTank said: That's why I just went straight for a 500
2012-09-06 17:02:19 ferrum said: have to ride at 10000 which is closer to redzone, and motorcycle starts making this wobbling noise like I'm hitting some resonance frequency and it's going to rip apart
2012-09-06 17:02:45 RagTheTank said: Yes that's what I was referring to ferrum
2012-09-06 17:02:51 ferrum said: no biggie~
2012-09-06 17:03:09 RagTheTank said: It has to scream its head off for highway riding
2012-09-06 17:03:14 RagTheTank said: Kills mpg
2012-09-06 17:03:20 ferrum said: I'll upgrade next winter or something
2012-09-06 17:03:26 RagTheTank said: Good
2012-09-06 17:03:30 ferrum said: to a 650 probably
2012-09-06 17:03:50 RagTheTank said: The ninja 650s are awesome
2012-09-06 17:04:03 RagTheTank said: But the 600 range has so much to offer
2012-09-06 17:04:24 RagTheTank said: Every manufacturer pretty much has a model
2012-09-06 17:06:15 ferrum said: killing mpg is fine
2012-09-06 17:06:21 ferrum said: I pay $8 every 2 weeks for gas now
2012-09-06 17:06:27 ferrum said: if it goes up to $10 I won't cry
2012-09-06 17:06:48 ferrum said: I spend more on milk than on gas
2012-09-06 17:08:24 RagTheTank said: True
2012-09-06 17:09:13 RagTheTank said: Just opointing out that smaller engine almost never equals better efficiency when it comes to cars or bikes
2012-09-06 17:10:06 RagTheTank said: The more power you have, the less the engine has to work
2012-09-06 17:10:54 BradPitt said: the more you have

2012-09-06 17:19:14 Number1Stunna said: yeah that's why things with big engines like heavy duty pickups get the best mileage, ferrum
2012-09-06 17:19:14 Number1Stunna said: duh
2012-09-06 17:19:25 ferrum said: I didn't say anything to either side of the argument
2012-09-06 17:19:41 ferrum said: this is like the RNC talking to an invisible Obama in a high-chair
2012-09-06 17:19:50 Number1Stunna said: well Rag is wrong
2012-09-06 17:20:02 Number1Stunna said: a bigger engine just burns more fuel
2012-09-06 17:20:18 Number1Stunna said: you should have argued with him.
2012-09-06 17:22:36 ferrum said: your argument is stupid and you should feel stupid
2012-09-06 17:22:56 ferrum said: wanna go home early so I can drive to autozone and get my vacuum pump @_@
2012-09-06 17:23:33 RagTheTank said: Number1Stunna not in huge pickups
2012-09-06 17:23:40 Number1Stunna said: not in ANYTHING
2012-09-06 17:23:45 RagTheTank said: Yes
2012-09-06 17:24:02 RagTheTank said: If you drive an m3 around atrack
2012-09-06 17:24:14 RagTheTank said: And then drive a Prius around that track
2012-09-06 17:24:24 RagTheTank said: The m3 will have better mpg
2012-09-06 17:24:35 Number1Stunna said: prove it.
2012-09-06 17:24:44 RagTheTank said: If they go the same speed
2012-09-06 17:24:49 Number1Stunna said: 30mph
2012-09-06 17:24:54 RagTheTank said: Sure
2012-09-06 17:24:56 Number1Stunna said: no way an M3 would get metter mpg than a Prius
2012-09-06 17:25:03 RagTheTank said: Yea it would
2012-09-06 17:25:11 RagTheTank said: The engine barely has to work
2012-09-06 17:25:39 RagTheTank said: Anyway I'm not going to sit here and argue with you about a subject you clearly have no grasp of
2012-09-06 17:25:43 Number1Stunna said: 13

2012-09-06 17:25:46 Number1Stunna said: that's the m3
2012-09-06 17:25:57 Number1Stunna said: Prius? combined 53mpg
2012-09-06 17:27:00 RagTheTank said: You are missing the point completely you fucking troglodyte
2012-09-06 17:27:14 Number1Stunna said: what's the point? that you don't know anything about cars because you've never driven one irl?
2012-09-06 17:27:58 RagTheTank said: A small engine screaming it's head off at 60 mpg will be less efficient than a big engine barely breaking a sweat
2012-09-06 17:28:16 Number1Stunna said: why would the small engine be "screaming its head off"?
2012-09-06 17:28:33 Number1Stunna said: i mean yeah engines get less fuel efficient at higher rpm
2012-09-06 17:28:34 Number1Stunna said: but...
2012-09-06 17:28:55 Number1Stunna said: at 30mph you can just be in the appropriate gear, in whatever vehicle. whether it's an M3 or a Prius
2012-09-06 17:29:00 Number1Stunna said: and neither engine will be "screaming its head off"
2012-09-06 17:30:21 RagTheTank said: Why are you using 30 mph as a reference
2012-09-06 17:30:24 RagTheTank said: Stop
2012-09-06 17:30:29 Number1Stunna said: ok well pick a speed
2012-09-06 17:30:32 Number1Stunna said: and use that as the reference
2012-09-06 17:30:36 Number1Stunna said: it doesn't matter.
2012-09-06 17:30:46 RagTheTank said: There is no speed you fucking idiot
2012-09-06 17:30:55 Number1Stunna said: maybe for you there isn't
2012-09-06 17:31:08 Number1Stunna said: & that kind of thinking is probably why you could never defeat me at simulation racing!
2012-09-06 17:31:11 RagTheTank said: My point is simple and clear
2012-09-06 17:31:15 RagTheTank said: And proven

2012-09-06 17:31:45 Number1Stunna said: so?

2012-09-06 19:44:12 ferrum said: OK so
2012-09-06 19:44:17 ferrum said: what have I learned today, three things
2012-09-06 19:44:45 ferrum said: 1) don't think it's an OK idea to be a white boy with a shiny motorcycle and ride it around the CA suburb equivalent of the projects (East Palo Alto)
2012-09-06 19:45:21 ferrum said: 2) get better gloves, because although 60 doesn't feel fast, your hands will go numb from the air rushing over them
2012-09-06 19:45:31 ferrum said: 3) don't think it's a good idea to go into an off-ramp at 40mph
2012-09-06 19:45:39 ferrum said: that's pretty much it, solid afternoon
2012-09-06 19:46:08 Raggles said: solid gains
2012-09-06 19:46:16 Raggles said: ferrum have you spilled the beans yet
2012-09-06 19:46:34 ferrum said: what beans
2012-09-06 19:46:52 ferrum said: you mean fuck up the bike?
2012-09-06 19:47:01 Raggles said: fall
2012-09-06 19:47:06 Raggles said: have you fallen yet
2012-09-06 19:47:09 ferrum said: luckily the car in front of me didn't break so I just leaned with it & rocked with it
2012-09-06 19:47:12 ferrum said: no
2012-09-06 19:47:12 ferrum said: brake*
2012-09-06 19:47:44 ferrum said: 100% true warrior, never fallen
2012-09-06 19:48:37 ferrum said: got my vacuum pump though B)
2012-09-06 19:50:12 Raggles said: make ur dick bigger
2012-09-06 19:51:58 ferrum said: hands are still freezing @_@
2012-09-06 19:52:11 Raggles said: lol
2012-09-06 19:54:05 ferrum said: oh I get how this vacuum thing works
2012-09-06 19:54:11 ferrum said: fuck why did I pay $37 for it, I could have made this shit myself
2012-09-06 19:56:23 coolguy said: wut
2012-09-06 19:56:57 Raggles said: ferrum are you going to make it portable
2012-09-06 19:57:12 Raggles said: or just a clunky piece of shit
2012-09-06 19:57:42 ferrum said: clunky piece of shit in like 70 parts haphazardly attached
2012-09-06 19:57:56 ferrum said: if it works I'll make a second revision and try to sell the first
2012-09-06 20:00:04 Blice said: lol
2012-09-06 20:00:35 Raggles said: go into business manufacturing affordable versions
2012-09-06 20:01:25 ferrum said: that's illegal, it's patented
2012-09-06 20:01:47 ferrum said: they'd have to find out about it though, since it's a civil action
2012-09-06 20:02:10 Raggles said: so we make enough money underground
2012-09-06 20:02:18 Raggles said: and then just buy them out
2012-09-06 20:02:28 Raggles said: before they even know what happened
2012-09-06 20:02:46 ferrum said: they're marketing to professional sports teams with the $3000 tag, basically
2012-09-06 20:02:53 Raggles said: ya
2012-09-06 20:03:25 Raggles said: goddamn
2012-09-06 20:03:33 Raggles said: if there is a way around the patent
2012-09-06 20:04:14 ferrum said: there might be, I haven't read it
2012-09-06 20:04:40 ferrum said: you could probably just sub something else for water-cooling
2012-09-06 20:04:48 ferrum said: like, uh, oil cooling
2012-09-06 20:04:58 ferrum said: or sell it as an oil
2012-09-06 20:05:05 ferrum said: or sell it as an oil cooler, and if people put in water, then so be it
2012-09-06 20:05:39 Raggles said: liquid nitrogen
2012-09-06 20:06:02 Raggles said: freon
2012-09-06 20:06:14 ferrum said: or make it for the feet B)
2012-09-06 20:06:26 Raggles said: ankle strap
2012-09-06 20:06:37 Raggles said: what would honestly work best
2012-09-06 20:06:41 Raggles said: is around the neck
2012-09-06 20:06:51 ferrum said: dem sore biceps
2012-09-06 20:06:59 Raggles said: that's where you put ice packs on someone with heat stroke
2012-09-06 20:07:17 Raggles said: because of the corodid and jugular
2012-09-06 20:07:18 ferrum said: housemate's gonna take me to home depot in his car because he's a true bro
2012-09-06 20:11:32 Raggles said: I wonder how this will translate into workouts/progress and the like
2012-09-06 20:11:48 Raggles said: in theory you will be able to do more every workout
2012-09-06 20:11:53 ferrum said: doesn't increase max
2012-09-06 20:12:01 Raggles said: but does this mean you need to take longer breaks in between workouts
2012-09-06 20:12:01 ferrum said: it should make volume day slightly less of a death march
2012-09-06 20:12:33 Raggles said: I suppose
2012-09-06 20:12:45 Raggles said: I feel as though it can be utilized much better than that though
2012-09-06 20:13:16 Raggles said: doing 10 sets of 5rm without getting too tired
2012-09-06 20:13:21 ferrum said: oh, heh
2012-09-06 20:13:59 Raggles said: oh wow
2012-09-06 20:14:01 Raggles said: I just realized
2012-09-06 20:14:12 Raggles said: you will be able to knock so much time off of workouts
2012-09-06 20:14:19 ferrum said: that's the goal, yeah
2012-09-06 20:14:28 ferrum said: right now 12-15 minutes between sets for volume squat
2012-09-06 20:14:42 Raggles said: rish
2012-09-06 20:14:45 Raggles said: right*
2012-09-06 20:15:09 Raggles said: I guess it doesn't mean much in the grander view
2012-09-06 20:15:21 Raggles said: meaning actual muscle recovery isn;t sped up
2012-09-06 20:15:23 Raggles said: or anything
2012-09-06 20:15:23 ferrum said: only worry is injury from overexertion
2012-09-06 20:15:31 ferrum said: and looking like a total dork xD
2012-09-06 20:15:34 Raggles said: lol
2012-09-06 20:16:21 Raggles said: basically what it will translate to
2012-09-06 20:16:28 Raggles said: is human heatsinks being produced
2012-09-06 20:16:40 ferrum said: I'm hoping it gets me laid for my ingenuity
2012-09-06 20:16:47 ferrum said: that's really the end-game here
2012-09-06 20:16:57 Raggles said: i don't think so tim
2012-09-06 20:17:10 Raggles said: unless that ingenuity leads you to make a fleshlight
2012-09-06 20:17:29 ferrum said: what if I go up to one of the cardio bunnes and have her insert her limb into my pressure chamber
2012-09-06 20:17:36 ferrum said: and then she's able to bust out 40 more miles
2012-09-06 20:17:49 Raggles said: then
2012-09-06 20:17:58 ferrum said: "oh ferrum your device has made me so much more chemically efficient, my horny levels are approaching 70%"
2012-09-06 20:17:59 Raggles said: she will be too exhausted to fight back after B)
2012-09-06 20:22:27 Blice said: "if you think it improves my squat sets you should see what the cooling glove does for me in bed"
2012-09-06 20:22:30 Blice said: flawless
2012-09-06 20:23:59 Raggles said: i don't think liquid cooling will help with the winky
2012-09-06 20:24:31 ferrum said: only problem I haven't solved is how to cool the water
2012-09-06 20:25:12 ferrum said: submerge a coil, regulate temp manually with some dial I guess
2012-09-06 20:25:28 Raggles said: ferrum what does the actual device use?
2012-09-06 20:25:36 ferrum said: don't know
2012-09-06 20:25:41 Raggles said: you could use a small compressor
2012-09-06 20:27:26 ferrum said: how does that work?
2012-09-06 20:28:34 Raggles said: compress the water
2012-09-06 20:28:38 Raggles said: thus
2012-09-06 20:28:40 ferrum said: wouldn't that heat it?
2012-09-06 20:28:40 Raggles said: cooling it
2012-09-06 20:28:43 Raggles said: n
2012-09-06 20:29:59 Raggles said: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_fluid
2012-09-06 20:31:07 Raggles said: that's a dumb idea
2012-09-06 20:31:12 Raggles said: dont listen
2012-09-06 20:31:16 Raggles said: it would be so loud
2012-09-06 20:32:25 Raggles said: alright
2012-09-06 20:32:46 Raggles said: hang on im thinking
2012-09-06 20:32:50 Blice said: icecubes
2012-09-06 20:32:56 Raggles said: they melt
2012-09-06 20:33:45 Raggles said: what you can do ferrum
2012-09-06 20:34:09 Raggles said: is get a small chilled water condesor
2012-09-06 20:34:16 Raggles said: coil
2012-09-06 20:35:01 Raggles said: http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/451594494/Air_Cooling_Condenser_FN_series.html
2012-09-06 20:35:02 Raggles said: maybe this
2012-09-06 20:35:51 Raggles said: I can't seem to find a small freezer condensor
2012-09-06 20:36:02 Raggles said: but if i do
2012-09-06 20:36:34 Raggles said: what you can do is use antifreeze as the liquid
2012-09-06 20:36:41 Raggles said: and have it be below 0
2012-09-06 20:37:10 Raggles said: I'm assuming the colder the liquid the more efficient the machine will be
2012-09-06 20:38:11 Raggles said: i'll try to figure something out
2012-09-06 20:38:19 Blice said: get dry ice
2012-09-06 20:38:22 Blice said: and then use a heating coil
2012-09-06 20:38:24 Blice said: to regulate
2012-09-06 20:38:25 Blice said: :D?
2012-09-06 20:38:46 Raggles said: not very feasile
2012-09-06 20:41:17 Raggles said: I bet you anything the $3000 one uses fucking ice

2012-09-06 22:50:09 ferrum said: Onijin when are you going to squat 2plate?
2012-09-06 22:50:27 BradPitt said: Onijin what does "Catching the bounce" on squats mean? The upward swing of the barbell?
2012-09-06 22:50:28 Onijin said: I squat 3 plate
2012-09-06 22:50:42 Onijin said: BradPitt: it means stretching your hamstrings
2012-09-06 22:50:43 Onijin said: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oV_yDdZYXA
2012-09-06 22:55:56 Onijin said: ferrum: I'm aiming for 150kg at the end of my next training cycle
2012-09-06 22:56:39 Onijin said: I'm at the end of week 3 out of 8
2012-09-06 22:56:55 BradPitt said: only 15lb?
2012-09-06 22:57:22 Onijin said: 15lb increase in 8 weeks is good
2012-09-06 22:57:27 ferrum said: lol.
2012-09-06 22:57:29 BradPitt said: not in my opinion
2012-09-06 22:57:36 ferrum said: onijin I go up by 5 weekly
2012-09-06 22:57:42 BradPitt said: ^
2012-09-06 22:57:47 Onijin said: good for you
2012-09-06 22:57:54 Onijin said: I look at a stick and my deadlift goes up
2012-09-06 22:57:58 Onijin said: what's your point again?
2012-09-06 22:58:05 BradPitt said: what is yours?
2012-09-06 22:58:06 ferrum said: wat
2012-09-06 22:58:29 Onijin said: My point is that 15lb in 8 weeks is a realistic goal
2012-09-06 22:58:40 BradPitt said: seems underachieving to me
2012-09-06 22:59:06 BradPitt said: especially at a sub-4 plate squat
2012-09-06 22:59:09 Onijin said: yeah, I only have the 2nd best total for my weight class in the whole of Australia
2012-09-06 22:59:25 BradPitt said: no one cares
2012-09-06 22:59:30 BradPitt said: this isnt about totals or competition or rankings
2012-09-06 22:59:38 BradPitt said: this is about linear progress at relatively low weights
2012-09-06 22:59:49 BradPitt said: so leave the non-sequitors out of the argument
2012-09-06 23:00:02 Onijin said: "linear progress" doesn't work for my squat
2012-09-06 23:00:11 BradPitt said: guess you're an anomoly then
2012-09-06 23:00:19 Onijin said: I tried that shit for one and a half years and made a 90kg squat
2012-09-06 23:00:32 BradPitt said: maybe you're weak
2012-09-06 23:00:43 Onijin said: Only went up when I stopped listening to internet experts
2012-09-06 23:00:58 Onijin said: exact same thing happened with ferrum 's deadlift
2012-09-06 23:03:20 Onijin said: I literally have no idea how anyone could be mad about an 11% increase on a main exercise in 8 weeks
2012-09-06 23:05:28 BradPitt said: I would be dissapointed sans injury
2012-09-06 23:05:42 Onijin said: What is your snatch
2012-09-06 23:05:47 BradPitt said: 70kg atm
2012-09-06 23:06:13 Onijin said: exactly
2012-09-06 23:06:26 BradPitt said: exactly what?
2012-09-06 23:07:39 Onijin said: if in 8 weeks time you snatched 77.5kg you would be satisfied
2012-09-06 23:07:49 ferrum said: alright, mos def a fever
2012-09-06 23:08:01 ferrum said: my guess is ear infection, because there's a huge lump below my left ear
2012-09-06 23:08:09 BradPitt said: completely different lift, oni
2012-09-06 23:08:17 BradPitt said: and completely different progress can be expected to be made
2012-09-06 23:08:28 Onijin said: Luckily percentages are proportional
2012-09-06 23:09:16 BradPitt said: the snatch is almost completely technique based
2012-09-06 23:09:21 Onijin said: so
2012-09-06 23:09:27 BradPitt said: and an increase in PR weight will come from technique
2012-09-06 23:09:43 BradPitt said: so if you fix technique in 1 night, you can put 10kg on your snatch (i went from 60 to 70)
2012-09-06 23:09:47 Onijin said: I know women, personally, that have been training less than a year that snatch more than you
2012-09-06 23:09:54 BradPitt said: wow thats awesome so do I
2012-09-06 23:10:03 BradPitt said: ive been oly lifting for less than a month
2012-09-06 23:10:06 BradPitt said: that isnt the point
2012-09-06 23:10:16 Onijin said: man, I'd be so disappointed sans injury at that
2012-09-06 23:10:17 BradPitt said: the point is that you can put much more weight on a squat than you can a snatch
2012-09-06 23:10:28 Onijin said: percentages are proportional luckily
2012-09-06 23:10:37 BradPitt said: snatch != squat
2012-09-06 23:10:51 Onijin said: and you're just as likely to increase your bench by 3% as you are your squat or deadlift or row or snatch or curl
2012-09-06 23:11:20 BradPitt said: depends on where they are at, tbh
2012-09-06 23:11:37 BradPitt said: the higher in weight you are, the harder it is to add weight
2012-09-06 23:11:41 Onijin said: And personally I think a 3% increase on any lift in 8 weeks would be good going
2012-09-06 23:11:51 BradPitt said: not for beginner numbers
2012-09-06 23:12:02 Onijin said: BradPitt: you're lifting beginner numbers though
2012-09-06 23:12:04 Raggles said: nah nigga i add 20lbs too all lifts every workout
2012-09-06 23:12:06 BradPitt said: yes i know
2012-09-06 23:12:11 BradPitt said: that is why i have the agency to speak on this topic
2012-09-06 23:12:16 Onijin said: so you have no point
2012-09-06 23:12:23 BradPitt said: no i actually do, if you paid attention
2012-09-06 23:12:35 BradPitt said: at beginner numbers, it is feasible and practical to put on 5lb per week
2012-09-06 23:12:40 BradPitt said: particularly for squats
2012-09-06 23:12:49 BradPitt said: ohp/bench probably not
2012-09-06 23:13:10 Onijin said: I don't have a beginner level squat
2012-09-06 23:13:11 Raggles said: you cannot consistently add 5lbs every workout
2012-09-06 23:13:16 BradPitt said: yes you do
2012-09-06 23:13:23 BradPitt said: you squat what, 3plate for 5?
2012-09-06 23:13:51 BradPitt said: <Onijin> I squat 3 plate
2012-09-06 23:13:53 Onijin said: BradPitt: I can count the people on one hand that are my weight that squat more than I do in my country
2012-09-06 23:14:03 BradPitt said: that means nothing
2012-09-06 23:14:07 BradPitt said: no one cares about your records
2012-09-06 23:14:12 BradPitt said: we are talking about programming and progress
2012-09-06 23:14:14 BradPitt said: not competitions
2012-09-06 23:14:23 Onijin said: you're an idiot if you don't factor in weight class
2012-09-06 23:14:32 BradPitt said: i do but you surely weigh above 77kg
2012-09-06 23:14:39 Onijin said: I weigh 65kg
2012-09-06 23:14:44 BradPitt said: aren't you like 6'1
2012-09-06 23:14:45 BradPitt said: ?
2012-09-06 23:14:48 Onijin said: no
2012-09-06 23:14:55 BradPitt said: how tall are you
2012-09-06 23:14:59 Onijin said: 5'10
2012-09-06 23:15:12 BradPitt said: wow
2012-09-06 23:15:18 BradPitt said: okay never mind just eat
2012-09-06 23:15:22 BradPitt said: forget what i just said
2012-09-06 23:15:35 Onijin said: I need to get to 75kg shredded in like 11 months
2012-09-06 23:15:45 Onijin said: to qualify for worlds
2012-09-06 23:15:59 Onijin said: well I'd already qualify for worlds
2012-09-06 23:16:14 Onijin said: but I want to make people embarrassed for even showing up
2012-09-06 23:16:38 BradPitt said: you're bench will put them to shame
2012-09-06 23:18:52 Onijin said: that's the thing BradPitt
2012-09-06 23:19:04 Onijin said: I need to play to my strengths
2012-09-06 23:19:16 Onijin said: I am not built for squatting, I am built to deadlift
2012-09-06 23:19:40 Onijin said: I could try really hard to get my squat up and make it decent and my deadlift would go up a bit
2012-09-06 23:20:12 Onijin said: or I could play to my strengths and get my deadlift up, which would increase my total much more as my deadlift will always progress faster than my squat as I am built for it
2012-09-06 23:20:30 Onijin said: I will never win best squatter at a meet simply because people who are built for it will get it
2012-09-06 23:20:48 Onijin said: I can easily get best deadlifter (as I did at my last meet) and best total
2012-09-06 23:21:03 Onijin said: So it makes sense to focus my training around the deadlift
2012-09-06 23:22:37 Onijin said: It would be like you focusing on your snatch instead of crushing shit with your clean and jerk
2012-09-06 23:46:59 ferrum said: got some advil
2012-09-07 00:16:40 BradPitt said: pb and milk time
2012-09-07 00:16:50 BradPitt said: ferrum is MDN a good place to learn JS?
2012-09-07 00:24:44 ferrum said: I think we have some tutorials, and we'd certainly like it to be
2012-09-07 00:24:58 BradPitt said: ill test it for you
2012-09-07 00:25:35 ferrum said: just conked out on my bed for about 40 minutes
2012-09-07 00:25:38 ferrum said: phew, I'm messed up.
2012-09-07 00:25:59 ferrum said: judging by the huge painful lump next to my left ear, I'm guessing ear infection
2012-09-07 00:26:10 ferrum said: no lifting for me :/
2012-09-07 00:26:18 BradPitt said: bummer =/
2012-09-07 00:26:31 ferrum said: yeah, pretty much means I can't do well at the competition

2012-09-07 01:36:01 BradPitt said: lamo
2012-09-07 01:36:16 ferrum said: stick my arm in there, measure how much of a vacuum it takes for my arm to turn completely red
2012-09-07 01:36:45 ferrum said: I rode into one of the shittiest parts of northern CA (excluding Oakland/Fremont) for this stuff
2012-09-07 01:36:48 ferrum said: better fucking work
2012-09-07 01:37:10 ferrum said: oh I just had a great idea!
2012-09-07 01:37:19 ferrum said: for cooling the water, couldn't I just buy one of those liquid-cooled PC systems?
2012-09-07 01:37:38 ferrum said: they recirculate and cool, and the google gym has a handy outlet by the squat rack so power isn't an issue
2012-09-07 01:39:01 BradPitt said: idk how fast the water needs to recirculate
2012-09-07 01:39:20 ferrum said: the faster the better
2012-09-07 01:40:07 ferrum said: apparently the water warms up very quickly though
2012-09-07 01:40:13 ferrum said: (which is a good sign that the thing is working)
2012-09-07 01:40:39 BradPitt said: also pc cooling uses molex connectors
2012-09-07 01:40:55 BradPitt said: so you would have to do some neato modifications to make it accept US outlets
2012-09-07 01:43:12 ferrum said: no idea how cooling water works
2012-09-07 01:43:25 ferrum said: everything that does it appears to be huge
2012-09-07 01:43:44 BradPitt said: so tempted to pull the trigger on these: http://www.6pm.com/onitsuka-tiger-by-asics-fabre-bl-l-og-vintage-black-yellow
2012-09-07 01:43:50 BradPitt said: well yeah
2012-09-07 01:43:56 BradPitt said: you need a large radiator surface to cool the water
2012-09-07 01:44:04 BradPitt said: pull air across it
2012-09-07 01:44:14 BradPitt said: and give time for the air to cool the water and let the heat pipes help dissapate
2012-09-07 01:44:49 ferrum said: can't be from air, otherwise how would it get colder than air?
2012-09-07 01:45:35 BradPitt said: moving air is cooler

2012-09-07 01:52:58 ferrum said: and I pulled as hard as I could
2012-09-07 01:53:04 ferrum said: and then I took it off and thought nothing more of it

2012-09-07 11:23:54 _vex_ said: Blice: I hadn't benched for 5ish days and the pain had gone away completely. Today I benched and I'm feeling it as I'm sitting down now, though it's VERY dull
2012-09-07 11:24:00 _vex_ said: it comes up randomly sometimes, a bit sharper
2012-09-07 11:24:13 _vex_ said: it will probably be gone again in two days of rest, but it's worrying me
2012-09-07 11:24:38 Blice said: weird.
2012-09-07 11:24:47 Blice said: since it's to the side it's musculator and not spinal
2012-09-07 11:24:56 Blice said: so I wouldn't be worried about a serious injury
2012-09-07 11:25:00 Blice said: but you could have pulled a muscle

2012-09-07 11:25:55 _vex_ said: yes, I'm pretty sure it's muscular, but I really need to figure out what the cause is
2012-09-07 11:26:57 _vex_ said: maybe I'm overarching? Though I posted a BP formcheck here and you guys told me I wasn't arching enough

2012-09-07 16:13:08 ferrum said: nhqe: probably yes, but I get a warm, fuzzy feeling knowing that I'm doing the right thing by helping Mozilla
2012-09-07 16:13:17 beaver said: implications
2012-09-07 16:13:20 beaver said: who needs them
2012-09-07 16:13:21 ferrum said: it is really important for the Web that Mozilla do well
2012-09-07 16:13:28 nhqe said: mozilla will do well without you

2012-09-07 16:15:37 nhqe said: so it's about the money to a poin?
2012-09-07 16:15:40 nhqe said: point*
2012-09-07 16:15:48 ferrum said: it's about respect, I have to feel that Mozilla respects and values me
2012-09-07 16:15:50 nhqe said: I mean what if they cut it but you could still live comfortably
2012-09-07 16:15:55 ferrum said: if they treat me like shit I'm not going to stick around
2012-09-07 16:16:08 nhqe said: what about half pay but that's because they're in a tight situatiom
2012-09-07 16:16:14 ferrum said: we are not in a tight situation :P
2012-09-07 16:16:14 nhqe said: and they need you there for them
2012-09-07 16:16:18 nhqe said: but they'd pay you more later on
2012-09-07 16:16:21 nhqe said: once they started doing better
2012-09-07 16:16:24 nhqe said: would you make that sacrifice?
2012-09-07 16:16:28 ferrum said: that's not a plausible reality, we have oodles of money
2012-09-07 16:16:35 nhqe said: hypothetically speaking though
2012-09-07 16:16:37 nhqe said: would you stay or leave?
2012-09-07 16:16:53 ferrum said: uh, depends on if I believe them, I guess

2012-09-07 16:19:02 wonderbeaver said: yet still manage to have so much money?
2012-09-07 16:20:06 ferrum said: non-profit doesn't mean we don't make money, it just means we can't be publicly traded
2012-09-07 16:20:44 ferrum said: we make money by cutting deals with search engines such as Google, Yandex, Baidu, Bing, etc
2012-09-07 16:20:53 ferrum said: they pay us to be included in Firefox's search stuff by default.
2012-09-07 16:23:43 beaver said: shit thats a lot
2012-09-07 16:23:50 beaver said: there≈õ nothing else they make profit off of ferrum ?
2012-09-07 16:24:21 beaver said: otherwise that means firefox gets financed by all those search engines
2012-09-07 16:24:37 ferrum said: we also have a store where we sell plushies :B

2012-09-07 16:27:08 beaver said: its funny that you are competing for survival with one of your clients
2012-09-07 16:27:29 ferrum said: they make more money from our deal than we do

2012-09-07 16:28:58 ferrum said: whereas at Mozilla, we want there to be more browsers, each with about an equal section of the share
2012-09-07 16:29:29 ferrum said: monopolies kill the web, though.
2012-09-07 16:29:29 beaver said: ferrum you have to fight off that nazi regime man

2012-09-07 21:07:37 Onijin said: BradPitt, white people are always slow into the hole
2012-09-07 21:07:38 BradPitt said: yeah i catch on my toes
2012-09-07 21:07:42 BradPitt said: then roll back
2012-09-07 21:07:56 ferrum said: another boss bites the dust
2012-09-07 21:07:59 RagTheTank said: once you come off of your heels and your gluets/hams disengage

2012-09-07 21:08:06 ferrum said: already in darkroot basin B)
2012-09-07 21:08:16 BradPitt said: you mean pressing up, RagTheTank ?
2012-09-07 21:08:28 RagTheTank said: once you go toes you are pretty much strictly using quads
2012-09-07 21:09:15 RagTheTank said: when you're catching the bar overhead

2012-09-07 21:09:55 BradPitt said: felt alright
2012-09-07 21:10:04 BradPitt said: really trying to focus on staying on my heels so my patella can trace correctly
2012-09-07 21:10:11 Blice said: yes definitely
2012-09-07 21:10:16 RagTheTank said: once you catch the bar the movement is no different than a normal squat
2012-09-07 21:10:23 Blice said: i get bad knee pains and quad irritation if I go on toes
2012-09-07 21:10:25 RagTheTank said: it's just an overhead squat
2012-09-07 21:10:34 BradPitt said: true
2012-09-07 21:10:37 BradPitt said: ill need to work on it
2012-09-07 21:10:43 BradPitt said: man i just want oly shoes ;_;
2012-09-07 21:10:47 RagTheTank said: coming off heels rapes your strength
2012-09-07 21:10:59 Blice said: I love my oly shoes
2012-09-07 21:11:01 Blice said: :D
2012-09-07 21:11:01 RagTheTank said: you lose at least 60% of powers
2012-09-07 21:11:10 Blice said: no way not 60%
2012-09-07 21:11:12 RagTheTank said: that is completely made up but it is a big percentage
2012-09-07 21:11:17 Blice said: cause I can still finish a max workset
2012-09-07 21:11:20 Blice said: if I go on toes
2012-09-07 21:11:26 Onijin said: you've lost 60% of your brain cells
2012-09-07 21:11:32 RagTheTank said: that's probably because you have been training that way
2012-09-07 21:11:47 Blice said: hm
2012-09-07 21:11:48 RagTheTank said: if you go to toes all the time then that becomes the strongest movement for you
2012-09-07 21:11:55 BradPitt said: maybe i need to pop off the hip higher
2012-09-07 21:12:00 BradPitt said: that will prevent me frmo shooting forward
2012-09-07 21:12:12 Blice said: BradPitt: so what is your plan with squats? what's next for you?
2012-09-07 21:12:19 Blice said: going to go 275?
2012-09-07 21:12:23 BradPitt said: not sure
2012-09-07 21:12:29 BradPitt said: we will see on sunday
2012-09-07 21:12:45 RagTheTank said: BradPitt it's probably a flexability issue more than anything
2012-09-07 21:12:57 RagTheTank said: you aren't really being thrown forward all that much
2012-09-07 21:13:02 RagTheTank said: i can't really tell though
2012-09-07 21:14:10 Blice said: >USA #1 shirt
2012-09-07 21:15:02 RagTheTank said: maybe simply just concentrating on landing on your heels will do it
2012-09-07 21:15:07 RagTheTank said: it's easy to just forget
2012-09-07 21:15:24 RagTheTank said: a lot goes through your head before lifts like the snatcher
2012-09-07 21:16:00 RagTheTank said: because I know you've said that you don't come off your heels for squats
2012-09-07 21:16:05 RagTheTank said: so the flexibility is there

2012-09-08 11:46:04 ferrum said: if you go back the Undead Asylum after you leave it, then go to your cell, you'll find a doll there
2012-09-08 11:46:18 ferrum said: about 1/3 through the game you go to this huge city called Amor Londo, and there's a huge room with a huge painting
2012-09-08 11:46:33 ferrum said: if the doll is in your inventory and you go up to the painting, it sucks you in and you're trapped
2012-09-08 11:46:36 ferrum said: and it's fucking difficult in here :/

2012-09-08 11:48:41 ferrum said: but they don't teach you anything, so it's a lot of key mashing to find out what buttons to use
2012-09-08 11:48:54 ferrum said: like Inventory is End, X is Delete, Y is Insert

2012-09-08 12:18:38 ferrum said: if you go to New Londo Ruins and chose the Master Key as the starting gift, you can skip through to Blighttown through the Valley of Drakes
2012-09-08 12:19:08 BradPitt said: does the starting perk amtter that much?
2012-09-08 12:19:11 BradPitt said: i got Master Key
2012-09-08 12:19:16 ferrum said: yes, everything is useless except master key
2012-09-08 12:19:31 ferrum said: everything else can be found in-game
2012-09-08 12:19:47 ferrum said: binoculars you can find at lvl1 if you run through the cemetary near the firelink shrine, all the way to the end

2012-09-08 14:50:24 oatzhakok said: at the start
2012-09-08 14:50:36 oatzhakok said: move your ass back away from the bar
2012-09-08 14:50:48 BradPitt said: what do you mean
2012-09-08 14:50:53 oatzhakok said: and your shoulders more over the bar

2012-09-08 14:52:51 BradPitt said: ah ok
2012-09-08 14:52:55 oatzhakok said: shoulders just in front of bar
2012-09-08 14:53:08 oatzhakok said: second thing
2012-09-08 14:53:15 oatzhakok said: your legs come up and your torso doesn't move
2012-09-08 14:53:21 oatzhakok said: they move in conjunction
2012-09-08 14:53:23 oatzhakok said: _however_
2012-09-08 14:53:40 oatzhakok said: your back angle does not change until the bar gets above your knee
2012-09-08 14:55:02 oatzhakok said: and you explode with the bar away from your body
2012-09-08 14:56:22 BradPitt said: holy SHIT http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRHkgrQ3LiM
2012-09-08 14:56:40 oatzhakok said: i'm emailing you some frame-by-frame shots

2012-09-08 14:56:46 BradPitt said: k, ty
2012-09-08 14:58:01 oatzhakok said: i'd say stick lifts from the high hang until you get some coaching
2012-09-08 14:58:11 oatzhakok said: stick to
2012-09-08 14:58:17 BradPitt said: mmk
2012-09-08 14:58:25 oatzhakok said: like hang power cleans and hang power snatches
2012-09-08 14:58:33 oatzhakok said: at least until you get shoes
2012-09-08 14:58:39 oatzhakok said: then do the full ones
2012-09-08 14:58:44 BradPitt said: just because of landing or what?
2012-09-08 14:58:49 oatzhakok said: yeah
2012-09-08 14:58:54 oatzhakok said: it's awkward as fuck
2012-09-08 14:58:59 oatzhakok said: and probably is bad for your ankles
2012-09-08 14:59:27 oatzhakok said: but when i started teaching myself last year, i did stuff exclusively from high hang
2012-09-08 14:59:30 oatzhakok said: for a long ass time
2012-09-08 15:05:37 BradPitt said: oatzhakok did your landing problems go away once you go oly shoes?
2012-09-08 15:06:04 oatzhakok said: not sure
2012-09-08 15:06:11 oatzhakok said: got oly shoes before i had any idea what i was doing
2012-09-08 15:06:17 oatzhakok said: what do you do for a warmup?
2012-09-08 15:07:01 BradPitt said: just the bar a couple times, then go up from like 40kg
2012-09-08 15:07:03 BradPitt said: usually doubles
2012-09-08 15:07:08 BradPitt said: triples at lighter weight
2012-09-08 15:07:28 oatzhakok said: ok i'll email you a good warmup you should do
2012-09-08 15:13:17 oatzhakok said: the warmup i sent you is what i do
2012-09-08 15:13:23 BradPitt said: thanks, reading it now
2012-09-08 15:13:30 oatzhakok said: after i've done some other dynamic warmups
2012-09-08 15:13:46 oatzhakok said: i'd suggest you do that warmup as written, and then figure out what is still tight
2012-09-08 15:13:57 oatzhakok said: so you know that next time you should warm up those parts first
2012-09-08 15:14:40 BradPitt said: word, looks good
2012-09-08 15:15:53 oatzhakok said: (Ôæü‚àÄÔæü)!!!!!
2012-09-08 16:13:56 Number1Stunna said: warming up is a waste of time
2012-09-08 16:18:53 ferrum said: BradPitt: back, what's up
2012-09-08 16:19:05 ferrum said: so far this cooling glove is costing about $160
2012-09-08 16:19:29 ferrum said: they didn't have 4" PVC pipe, so I got 4" ABS pipe
2012-09-08 16:19:38 ferrum said: which is probably way harder to thread into
2012-09-08 16:20:04 ferrum said: also went with brass handle
2012-09-08 16:20:10 ferrum said: because they just don't make threaded copper 5" nipples
2012-09-08 16:20:23 ferrum said: I'd have to thread it myself, which is a different project
2012-09-08 16:47:34 ferrum said: managed to saw through it with a PVC saw, so it's probably at least comparable.
2012-09-08 16:49:07 thootwoops said: brap
2012-09-08 16:59:16 ferrum said: man this shit looks sexy already

2012-09-08 17:00:40 BradPitt said: yes
2012-09-08 17:00:55 ferrum said: where's the guy with an iron club?
2012-09-08 17:01:04 ferrum said: you don't really need to farm in this game... being higher level doesn't really help

2012-09-08 17:01:21 ferrum said: OH, HAVEL
2012-09-08 17:01:23 ferrum said: ahahhahaha
2012-09-08 17:01:24 BradPitt said: he hurts
2012-09-08 17:01:25 BradPitt said: ;_;
2012-09-08 17:01:33 ferrum said: he always one-shots no matter what your level is
2012-09-08 17:01:38 ferrum said: go UP the spiral, NOT DOWN
2012-09-08 17:01:40 BradPitt said: then this black knight footfucked me as well in some corridor
2012-09-08 17:01:41 ferrum said: lmao.
2012-09-08 17:01:59 ferrum said: yes, don't go there either. Although if you want, you can just run past that guy and get a pretty good ring (+def when low HP)
2012-09-08 17:02:13 ferrum said: so I just beat havel yesterday
2012-09-08 17:02:23 ferrum said: the way to beat him is to take off all your armor so that you're totally naked
2012-09-08 17:02:40 ferrum said: then get as close as you can to him and strafe until he attacks
2012-09-08 17:02:47 ferrum said: when he attacks, move behind him and execute a backstab
2012-09-08 17:02:55 ferrum said: you have to do that about 10 times without ever getting hit
2012-09-08 17:03:10 ferrum said: he drops a ring that greatly reduces equipment burden
2012-09-08 17:03:28 ferrum said: took me about 5 tries and I was way higher level than you, with the drake sword
2012-09-08 17:03:54 BradPitt said: how do you backstab
2012-09-08 17:04:15 ferrum said: move perfectly behind them (very low margin of error) while they're locked-on, and execute a weak attack
2012-09-08 17:04:31 ferrum said: it'll switch to an animation of you stabbing them and them falling down, and you're invincible for the duration of the animation
2012-09-08 17:04:55 BradPitt said: oh, nice
2012-09-08 17:06:32 ferrum said: did you beat the taurus demon?

2012-09-08 17:11:00 ferrum said: you should find out on your own
2012-09-08 17:11:11 ferrum said: the game intentionally doesn't tell you stuff so that you learn it for yourself
2012-09-08 17:11:15 ferrum said: the whole game is about trial and error
2012-09-08 17:11:18 ferrum said: don't look it up on a wiki
2012-09-08 17:12:46 Number1Stunna said: hey do you guys know how to get the wizard's key on the 35th level of the dungeon where you fight the dragon master?
2012-09-08 17:13:10 ferrum said: it's a lot more important if you're playing with multiplayer enabled, though
2012-09-08 17:15:24 BradPitt said: fuarg ok

2012-09-08 21:52:13 ferrum said: with a 5" brass nipple (instead of copper)
2012-09-08 21:52:13 RagTheTank said: at this point you should just invest in renting a resaraunts freezer
2012-09-08 21:52:16 RagTheTank said: and train in there
2012-09-08 21:52:52 ferrum said: and 1/4" -> 3/16" adaptors for the hoses (instead of 3/16 -> 3/16)
2012-09-08 21:53:12 ferrum said: 3/16" looks like it's handled by drilling a hole 1/2"
2012-09-08 21:53:21 ferrum said: so 1/4" is off by... just a little bit :/

2012-09-09 11:52:27 ferrum said: inferior to PS3 version but still fun
2012-09-09 11:53:14 ferrum said: PC version is capped at 30FPS, key bindings don't make sense until you figure them out by brute force, and battles requiring holding the mouse without moving it a pixel or you change targeting
2012-09-09 11:53:18 ferrum said: other than that, still tons of fun
2012-09-09 11:53:43 thootwoops said: why is everyone playing that game?
2012-09-09 11:53:43 ferrum said: I'm still stuck getting to the second bonfire in anor londo @_@
2012-09-09 11:53:47 ferrum said: never got past that point
2012-09-09 11:53:53 ferrum said: thootwoops: it was re-released for PC about a week ago
2012-09-09 11:54:18 ferrum said: it's a beautiful game with the best gameplay I've ever experienced
2012-09-09 11:54:26 ferrum said: if you haven't played it, you should; it's basically perfect.
2012-09-09 11:54:35 thootwoops said: pretty sure I watched my brother playing it
2012-09-09 11:54:47 thootwoops said: it's the one with all the undead people throwing firebombs in a castle, right?
2012-09-09 11:56:13 ferrum said: yeah that's the very beginning
2012-09-09 11:56:32 ferrum said: it's an extremely long game with tons of areas (including huge optional ones hidden behind false walls)
2012-09-09 11:56:46 ferrum said: and even at high levels, even the most basic enemy can kill you fairly easily
2012-09-09 11:56:58 thootwoops said: interesting...
2012-09-09 11:57:07 thootwoops said: seemed pretty run of the mill crappy game from what I saw

2012-09-09 11:57:24 Stefano said: just don't play it on pc if possible
2012-09-09 11:57:31 ferrum said: yeah console version is much better
2012-09-09 11:57:31 Stefano said: it has one of the worst portings ever

And I came up with: my non-work projects, being social, teaching, and learning (this list may be a tiny bit contrived). So I thought, why not do a skillshare and/or provide space to be social whilst hacking on non-work projects?

2012-09-10 12:29:05 ferrum said: PPS: Alan here! The things I teach most nowadays are pretty common skills in this group (physics, programming, etc.). Uncommon skills I could teach include playing flute, facilitating group challenges, and sign language.
2012-09-10 12:30:19 ferrum said: We could teach: making backpacking stoves, leather working, making slings, making traps, friction fire, hide tanning, knitting, spinning, weaving if anyone's super interested, knot tying, how to pitch a tarp, how to make jerky or fruit leather, survival bracelets, knife sharpening, EMT/medical stuff (like taking blood pressure), and you know... other stuff :D.

2012-09-10 12:37:37 BradPitt said: also can i go back to the bonfire and refill my flasks without him respawning?
2012-09-10 12:37:41 BradPitt said: like is he dead for good?
2012-09-10 12:39:05 ferrum said: bosses are dead for good yes
2012-09-10 12:39:08 ferrum said: but don't go back
2012-09-10 12:39:12 ferrum said: go to the dragon bridge
2012-09-10 12:39:13 BradPitt said: but i need to level
2012-09-10 12:39:20 ferrum said: you're almost at another bonfire
2012-09-10 12:39:29 ferrum said: the same one, actually, but you can make a shortcut to it exist
2012-09-10 12:39:44 ferrum said: cross the taurus demon bridge and head right, talk to the guy there
2012-09-10 12:39:47 ferrum said: you'll get a white soapstone
2012-09-10 12:39:51 ferrum said: turn around and go to the dragon bridge
2012-09-10 12:40:06 ferrum said: run out a little bit to aggro it, then run all the way back in
2012-09-10 12:40:10 BradPitt said: yeah Solaria or whatever
2012-09-10 12:40:13 BradPitt said: i talked to him
2012-09-10 12:40:13 ferrum said: keep trying until you figure out the right distance
2012-09-10 12:40:16 ferrum said: brb
2012-09-10 12:40:18 BradPitt said: ok
2012-09-10 12:41:24 Raggles said: right in the old johnson
2012-09-10 12:42:52 ferrum said: once you're safely running on the dragon bridge, there's a down staircase on the right at about the middle of the bridge
2012-09-10 12:43:09 ferrum said: that leads to an empty room with two doors, one forward to the shortcut, one right to the Undead Parish
2012-09-10 12:43:26 ferrum said: take the shortcut, press A to kick down the ladder, go down ladder, rest at bonfire
2012-09-10 12:43:32 ferrum said: ez pz

2012-09-10 12:48:25 BradPitt said: its the same bonfire
2012-09-10 12:48:26 BradPitt said: ( ‚âñ‚Äø‚âñ)
2012-09-10 12:48:28 BradPitt said: clever level design
2012-09-10 12:48:39 ferrum said: BradPitt: all the levels are connected like that
2012-09-10 12:48:45 BradPitt said: smart
2012-09-10 12:48:46 ferrum said: you can in fact see them from other areas
2012-09-10 12:48:51 ferrum said: the game engine is amazing
2012-09-10 12:48:55 Raggles said: saves time and resources
2012-09-10 12:49:29 ferrum said: well it's mostly just for clever hidden shortcuts that let you bypass stuff
2012-09-10 12:50:11 ferrum said: in the darkroot garden, instead of paying 20,000 souls to buy the seal of artorias to unlock the darkroot forest, you can travel to the (hidden and completely unnecessary to ever visit) darkroot basin
2012-09-10 12:50:26 ferrum said: and defeat the water hydra there, then take a hidden ladder up behind a waterfall, and you're in the forest
2012-09-10 12:50:40 BradPitt said: wtf i cant aim with the short bow
2012-09-10 12:50:49 ferrum said: this is btw right next to wear BradPitt is now -- if he takes the tower spiral down, that's where Havel is, and outside the door is Darkroot Basin
2012-09-10 12:50:59 ferrum said: BradPitt: yes you can
2012-09-10 12:51:16 ferrum said: I think it's left trigger or something? you can aim in FPS mode
2012-09-10 12:51:33 BradPitt said: yeah i press Y to hold with both hands and then hold L1 and it does nothing
2012-09-10 12:51:40 ferrum said: don't hold with both hands
2012-09-10 12:51:55 ferrum said: you need to be drawing the bow already
2012-09-10 12:52:02 ferrum said: with the bow drawn and held, press the left trigger
2012-09-10 12:52:19 ferrum said: and you should be standing on the bridge underneath the dragon, where the skeleton with the shield was
2012-09-10 12:52:50 BradPitt said: still not doing anything
2012-09-10 12:53:10 ferrum said: don't know controller controls, keep pressing stuff :P
2012-09-10 12:53:20 ferrum said: it might be like right-stick pressed in or something
2012-09-10 12:54:19 BradPitt said: oh i got it
2012-09-10 12:54:30 BradPitt said: >mfw i was pressing R1

2012-09-10 13:00:47 BradPitt said: hot many fuckign arrows does this take
2012-09-10 13:00:52 ferrum said: I'll attest to this. I never finished P90X, I only made it through the first 30-35 days of P90X (and I've tried three times over 2 years, but each time I either got injured or life obligations got in the way), and I weigh 20 lbs less. It's definitely not for everyone because it is INTENSE, but it's also definitely not a gimmick -- just good old fashioned exercise and diet.
2012-09-10 13:00:57 ferrum said: are you using wooden arrows?
2012-09-10 13:00:59 BradPitt said: yes
2012-09-10 13:01:03 BradPitt said: wasted them all ;_;

2012-09-10 13:01:11 BradPitt said: fuarg
2012-09-10 13:01:19 ferrum said: you always want 999 arrows around
2012-09-10 13:01:23 ferrum said: because you need them for like
2012-09-10 13:01:28 ferrum said: every part of the game to lure out enemies
2012-09-10 13:01:35 ferrum said: otherwise you get gangraped

2012-09-11 00:40:41 ferrum said: haven't found a glove good enough
2012-09-11 00:43:31 Raggles said: what does it need to be?
2012-09-11 00:44:48 ferrum said: rubber and tight around my forearm
2012-09-11 00:45:30 Raggles said: can you use a normal rubber glove and then just have something to wrap arouynf your forearm
2012-09-11 00:45:37 Raggles said: or even just use a rubber band
2012-09-11 00:45:45 Raggles said: or something
2012-09-11 00:46:44 ferrum said: possibly yeah

2012-09-11 00:48:17 ferrum said: dude
2012-09-11 00:48:25 ferrum said: it creates such a fucking good seal that when you insert your hand, you can't even take it out
2012-09-11 00:49:24 ferrum said: the only downside is that the opening looks uncannily like a vagina
2012-09-11 00:50:48 Raggles said: people are going to wonder why you brought a fleshlight to the gym
2012-09-11 00:51:35 ferrum said: the PTs are going to hate this
2012-09-11 00:53:07 ferrum said: latex tears really easily :/
2012-09-11 00:53:25 ferrum said: or these $1.49 for 10 gloves are just shit
2012-09-11 00:54:18 ferrum said: huh
2012-09-11 00:54:22 ferrum said: creating a vacuum destroyed the glove >_>
2012-09-11 00:54:34 ferrum said: so OK, heavier glove.

2012-09-11 01:06:42 ferrum said: Raggles: the rubber glove doesn't break, but it can't create a vacuum
2012-09-11 01:06:53 ferrum said: it sucks in a lot but to no real meaningful degree, and it leaks

2012-09-11 07:11:13 _vex_ said: so, lower back pain and decided to take a week of lifting without squats to see if they're the reason. Which other exercise can I add in instead, which doesn't hit lower back and which will still let my body recover at the same rate as if doing squats?
2012-09-11 07:11:30 _vex_ said: I'm asking because not squatting must give some extra potential for recovery and I wouldn't want to waste it
2012-09-11 07:34:09 _vex_ said: >please respond
2012-09-11 07:38:33 Blice said: what lifts are you already doing this week?
2012-09-11 08:31:02 _vex_ said: Blice: Doing all other things normally in SS
2012-09-11 08:31:20 _vex_ said: so DL, OHP, bench, PC
2012-09-11 08:31:23 _vex_ said: maybe I should abandon PC too
2012-09-11 08:31:43 _vex_ said: though I've done it very lightweight and focused on technique so I doubt it's doing much harm
2012-09-11 08:45:12 Blice said: you're aware DL uses your lower back more than squats do right?
2012-09-11 09:32:28 _vex_ said: yes Blice, but with squats I've been going low and rounded my back, and I believe that's the cause
2012-09-11 09:32:38 _vex_ said: but maybe I shouldn't do either for the "week off"
2012-09-11 09:32:42 _vex_ said: though that'll suck..
2012-09-11 09:34:23 Blice said: maybe you should just do a light week
2012-09-11 09:34:28 Blice said: where you do every lift at 80%
2012-09-11 09:34:34 Blice said: or 90%

2012-09-11 10:10:55 oatzbook said: using opencv
2012-09-11 10:11:25 oatzbook said: opencv has headers in python, c, and c++ so we can use any of those
2012-09-11 10:12:03 oatzbook said: i'm leaning towards python cuz i know more people itc are familiar with it than c/c++

2012-09-11 10:15:54 oatzbook said: it will tell you what points are interesting to track

2012-09-11 10:16:28 oatzbook said: if you put bright colored tape on the bar
2012-09-11 10:16:33 oatzbook said: tracking that isn't so hard
2012-09-11 10:16:38 oatzbook said: like neon pink or smth

2012-09-11 13:32:37 Blice said: chrome it progresses really nice
2012-09-11 13:32:48 Blice said: firefox it like, flies up to 70% or so and then stops
2012-09-11 13:32:57 Blice said: and then takes a minute more for the file to actually finish uploading
2012-09-11 13:33:08 Blice said: :(
2012-09-11 13:33:31 Blice said: what do
2012-09-11 13:34:39 BradPitt said: open a bug report

2012-09-11 13:36:22 ferrum said: Blice: I'm not sure how progress even works. ACcording to the XMLHttpRequest Level 2 specification,
2012-09-11 13:36:36 ferrum said: "When it is said to make progress notifications, while the download is progressing, queue a task to fire a progress event named progress about every 50ms or for every byte received, whichever is least frequent."
2012-09-11 13:37:19 Blice said: download ?
2012-09-11 13:37:20 Blice said: hrm
2012-09-11 13:37:25 ferrum said: are you uploading?
2012-09-11 13:37:26 ferrum said: then:
2012-09-11 13:37:32 ferrum said: "While the request entity body is being uploaded and the upload complete flag is false, queue a task to fire a progress event named progress at the XMLHttpRequestUpload object about every 50ms or for every byte transmitted, whichever is least frequent."
2012-09-11 13:37:32 Blice said: yes uploading
2012-09-11 13:37:48 Blice said: yes
2012-09-11 13:38:02 Blice said: so I handle the progress event on the XMLHttpRequestUpload object
2012-09-11 13:38:08 ferrum said: so -- are you not receiving the events? is your % calculation wrong?
2012-09-11 13:38:26 Blice said: I receive events until it gets to 70 to 90% and then it hangs for awhile
2012-09-11 13:38:30 Blice said: until it actually finishs the upload
2012-09-11 13:38:42 Blice said: where as on chromium the upload smoothly increases progress until it finishes
2012-09-11 13:39:00 Blice said: so firefox goes way fast and then stops sending events until the upload is done
2012-09-11 13:44:21 Blice said: in my boss's case he tried a large file and it zoomed to 13% and then just stopped there while it finishes uploading for the next 10 minutes
2012-09-11 13:44:24 Blice said: fuark
2012-09-11 13:45:46 ferrum said: well that's no good, and I don't see a bug on file
2012-09-11 13:46:11 ferrum said: I would file a bug in bugzilla, then use window.setInterval() to use any existing historical data to lie about upload progress

2012-09-11 13:49:27 ferrum said: "Starting in Gecko 9.0 (Firefox 9.0 / Thunderbird 9.0 / SeaMonkey 2.6), progress events can now be relied upon to come in for every chunk of data received, including the last chunk in cases in which the last packet is received and the connection closed before the progress event is fired. In this case, the progress event is automatically fired when the load event occurs for that packet. This lets you now reliably monitor progress by only watching the "progress
2012-09-11 13:49:34 ferrum said: what version are you using?
2012-09-11 13:50:01 ferrum said: that suggests that the problem is already fixed.
2012-09-11 13:51:49 ferrum said: also plausible: you were setting the listener on the XMLHttpRequest object itself, and not on it's upload properyt
2012-09-11 13:52:02 Blice said: 15.0.1, the listener is on the upload property
2012-09-11 13:52:04 ferrum said: since each upload also downloads some data, you were therefore only seeing progress on the download half

2012-09-12 16:23:30 ferrum said: he's the only one that sells uncurse tablets
2012-09-12 16:23:37 ferrum said: if you get cursed, you're fucked haha
2012-09-12 16:23:40 Stefano said: haha
2012-09-12 16:23:46 ferrum said: cursing leaves you at 50% HP max
2012-09-12 16:23:49 ferrum said: forever
2012-09-12 16:23:55 Stefano said: I'll just reload the game
2012-09-12 16:24:00 ferrum said: that doesn't revive him...
2012-09-12 16:24:05 Stefano said: what if I
2012-09-12 16:24:10 Stefano said: ctrl alt canc the game
2012-09-12 16:24:11 Stefano said: MAYBE
2012-09-12 16:24:23 ferrum said: no, it saves immediately as soon as you aggro an NPC
2012-09-12 16:24:30 ferrum said: the NPC is never un-aggroed
2012-09-12 16:25:25 Stefano said: haha yeah fuck it's dead
2012-09-12 16:25:27 Stefano said: oh well
2012-09-12 16:25:41 Stefano said: who needs 100% hp anyway
2012-09-12 16:26:21 ferrum said: now get to Quelaag's and ring the second bell :D
2012-09-12 16:26:26 ferrum said: lol gl
2012-09-12 16:27:06 Stefano said: where do I go now?=
2012-09-12 16:27:26 ferrum said: in the beginning of the game, they told you that one bell is up above, one bell down below
2012-09-12 16:27:32 ferrum said: maybe go down??? idk
2012-09-12 16:27:39 Stefano said: yeah there's the elevator
2012-09-12 16:28:10 ferrum said: the easy way is to go back to Firelink and take the down-spiral to New Londo Ruins
2012-09-12 16:28:23 ferrum said: if you hug the right, there's a shortcut to Valley of Drakes, which immediately puts you in the back exit to Blighttown
2012-09-12 16:28:46 ferrum said: the hard way is to go back to Undead Burg and go to Lower Undead Burg, then through the Depths, which brings you to Blighttown via the front entrance
2012-09-12 16:28:58 ferrum said: if you do the latter, you get the sword that I have
2012-09-12 16:29:48 Stefano said: so undead burg then lwoer burg then depths
2012-09-12 16:30:01 ferrum said: yeah, the entrance to lower undead burg is the locked door on the bridge with the fire dragon
2012-09-12 16:30:48 ferrum said: for what it's worth, I always do the easy way first
2012-09-12 16:31:58 ferrum said: oh, also, you should know that the assassins in blighttown are special monsters that don't respawn after they're killed
2012-09-12 16:32:05 ferrum said: they make you Toxic, which rapidly drains HP

2012-09-12 16:47:23 ferrum said: that was the only other NPC that sold the curse remover
2012-09-12 16:47:24 Stefano said: he ran away saying
2012-09-12 16:47:28 ferrum said: you are now actually fucked.
2012-09-12 16:47:28 Stefano said: you're just another client

2012-09-12 16:47:53 Stefano said: they look like monsters
2012-09-12 16:48:01 ferrum said: they are, exercise restraint
2012-09-12 16:48:20 Stefano said: man I thought I was already fucked
2012-09-12 16:48:23 ferrum said: you don't even know how screwed you are
2012-09-12 16:48:27 ferrum said: no, that girl could have saved you
2012-09-12 16:48:38 Stefano said: man
2012-09-12 16:48:41 Stefano said: no way that was a girl man
2012-09-12 16:49:08 Stefano said: it was where you meet the first rat
2012-09-12 16:49:43 ferrum said: yes, that is the female undead merchant
2012-09-12 16:49:50 ferrum said: the male is the other one
2012-09-12 16:49:55 ferrum said: you're fucked.
2012-09-12 16:50:26 Stefano said: should I quit then?
2012-09-12 16:50:39 ferrum said: no, you should deal with the consequences :P
2012-09-12 16:51:00 Stefano said: suddenly double estus flasks
2012-09-12 16:51:01 Stefano said: idk how tho
2012-09-12 16:51:17 ferrum said: rested at firelink shrine?
2012-09-12 16:51:22 Stefano said: yes
2012-09-12 16:51:25 ferrum said: yes, that gives you 10
2012-09-12 16:51:31 ferrum said: other bonfires can also give you 10 if you kindle them
2012-09-12 16:52:01 BradPitt said: what is kindling
2012-09-12 16:52:07 Stefano said: maybe that fem merchant isn't mad ferrum
2012-09-12 16:52:14 Stefano said: maybe she just thinks I'm alpha
2012-09-12 16:52:18 Stefano said: she's gonna give me a discount now
2012-09-12 16:53:12 ferrum said: BradPitt: if you're human and you have humanity, you can spend that humanity to increase by 5 the number of estus flasks a bonfire gives you
2012-09-12 16:53:29 ferrum said: initially the max is 10, once you beat the first Catacombs boss, that goes up to 15 or 20 (haven't tried past 15)
2012-09-12 16:53:53 BradPitt|laptop said: oh i have hugh manatees
2012-09-12 16:53:59 BradPitt|laptop said: like 6 or something
2012-09-12 16:54:07 ferrum said: spend them all
2012-09-12 16:54:14 BradPitt|laptop said: really?
2012-09-12 16:54:42 Stefano said: boss time
2012-09-12 16:55:18 ferrum said: BradPitt: yes, you'll die frequently in this game
2012-09-12 16:55:24 ferrum said: better to spend whatever you have as soon as you can
2012-09-12 16:55:35 ferrum said: oh, you have 6 humanity *items*
2012-09-12 16:55:42 ferrum said: no, keep the items, don't use them
2012-09-12 16:55:53 ferrum said: "having humanity" means that the counter in the upper-left corner isn't 00
2012-09-12 16:56:04 BradPitt|laptop said: so wtf is the difference
2012-09-12 16:58:58 BradPitt|laptop said: I'm STILL peeling

2012-09-12 16:59:22 Stefano said: intel time
2012-09-12 17:00:12 ferrum said: Stefano: the next mandatory boss for you is Quelaag
2012-09-12 17:00:22 Stefano said: oki
2012-09-12 17:00:40 ferrum said: if you took the hard way instead of the easy way
2012-09-12 17:00:52 ferrum said: your next bosses are the Capra Demon, followed by the Gaping Dragon
2012-09-12 17:01:13 ferrum said: and only then Quelaag
2012-09-12 17:01:38 ferrum said: BradPitt: humanity that's held in the upper-left corner is dropped ala souls when you die
2012-09-12 17:01:43 ferrum said: items are kept
2012-09-12 17:01:53 Stefano said: ok so
2012-09-12 17:01:54 Stefano said: capra demon

2012-09-12 17:02:24 Stefano said: I'm stefano THE UNCURSED
2012-09-12 17:02:35 ferrum said: you can come back and fight him later when you have better armor, which you'll get after killing Quelaag
2012-09-12 17:03:16 ferrum said: Stefano: do you remember how you got into the valley of drakes?
2012-09-12 17:03:21 ferrum said: I forgot what leads to the front entrance
2012-09-12 17:03:29 ferrum said: oh, right, that shit in the darkroot basin
2012-09-12 17:03:30 ferrum said: nm
2012-09-12 17:03:32 Stefano said: yeah
2012-09-12 17:03:54 Stefano said: hey this capra fag doesn't look so strong man
2012-09-12 17:04:01 Stefano said: inb4 over 20 hours to beat him
2012-09-12 17:07:16 Stefano said: here I go
2012-09-12 17:17:13 Stefano said: dem butchers
2012-09-12 17:19:19 ferrum said: capra is hard
2012-09-12 17:19:28 ferrum said: the only good way I've found to do it is to trick him into being below that ledge
2012-09-12 17:19:34 ferrum said: then run up the stairs and do a plunging attack
2012-09-12 17:19:34 Stefano said: already beaten

2012-09-15 22:28:42 BradPitt said: i think you're right, still driving through midfoot instead of all heel
2012-09-15 22:28:46 BradPitt said: first rep is okay-ish
2012-09-15 22:29:05 Blice said: driving through midish foot is necessary with normal shoes I think
2012-09-15 22:29:09 BradPitt said: yeah
2012-09-15 22:29:10 Blice said: but heels is where it's at w/ oly shoes

2012-09-16 04:42:02 Raggles said: what are you doing
2012-09-16 04:42:06 rfw said: SS
2012-09-16 04:42:10 rfw said: but without powercleans for now
2012-09-16 04:42:30 Raggles said: SS does include cleans if I remember correctly
2012-09-16 04:42:36 rfw said: yeah
2012-09-16 04:42:44 rfw said: but i took them out for now because i need to work on my other lifts
2012-09-16 04:42:44 Raggles said: theres a few different variations
2012-09-16 04:42:47 rfw said: before i can do them
2012-09-16 04:42:53 Raggles said: oh
2012-09-16 04:42:57 Raggles said: you're not doing them
2012-09-16 04:43:01 rfw said: yeah
2012-09-16 04:43:05 rfw said: so i'm just doing OHP and chinups
2012-09-16 04:43:14 Raggles said: what do you mean you need to work on other lifts before you can do them?
2012-09-16 04:43:42 rfw said: like, need to get the technique better
2012-09-16 04:43:54 Raggles said: oh
2012-09-16 04:44:00 rfw said: i can do them ok but when i try to do a powerclean it all falls to shit
2012-09-16 04:44:08 Raggles said: well that will only happen if you actually do the lift
2012-09-16 04:44:18 rfw said: yeah i know
2012-09-16 04:44:28 rfw said: probably just a lame excuse for the fact that powercleans are scary
2012-09-16 04:44:31 Raggles said: getting better at squats isn't going to help your clean form
2012-09-16 04:44:40 Raggles said: just start with the bar
2012-09-16 04:44:46 Raggles said: and add 5lbs every workout
2012-09-16 04:44:58 rfw said: yeah

2012-09-16 06:21:03 sabar said: " we are just going to kill you"
2012-09-16 06:21:05 sabar said: I know
2012-09-16 06:21:07 nhqe said: lolwat

2012-09-16 06:21:17 nhqe said: pretty sure that's a drug dealer man
2012-09-16 06:21:20 Raggles said: sabar do you owe money to the finnish mafia

2012-09-16 06:22:29 sabar said: but they still harass me
2012-09-16 06:22:44 Raggles said: so why don't you tell the cops
2012-09-16 06:23:14 sabar said: cause cops are part of it too? and they told me if I call cops over anything they are just going to beat the shit out of me and take me to those "harassers" to be killed

2012-09-16 06:31:11 Raggles said: what have they said to you?
2012-09-16 06:31:19 Raggles said: exactly
2012-09-16 06:32:47 sabar said: they told me that it was just introduced to them too and they had no choice of saying no to it, and they have no idea what it is really.. or they told me they have no idea what is going on, they are just part of it or they would be killed etc
2012-09-16 06:33:26 Raggles said: you mean they were intoruced into the contract of your killing?
2012-09-16 06:33:42 sabar said: no I mean they were introduced into the system

2012-09-16 06:43:28 Number1Stunna said: to keep you living in your mom's basement forever
2012-09-16 06:43:32 Number1Stunna said: and it's also the reason you are fat.
2012-09-16 06:44:11 sabar said: well in my old town they did hold me down.. they threatened me with knifes in school and shit so I would leave it
2012-09-16 06:44:18 sabar said: cops tried to convince me to become drug dealer
2012-09-16 06:44:20 sabar said: etc
2012-09-16 06:44:34 Raggles said: I think that's the mafia
2012-09-16 06:44:37 Raggles said: not the government
2012-09-16 06:44:53 Raggles said: since when was finland such a fucked up place
2012-09-16 06:45:55 frogprince said: Bizarre, but it happens a lot. I got a lot of dirty looks when I started going to the gym a few years ago, and some really nasty just loud enough to intentionally overhear comments, which of course made me stop going to the gym.
2012-09-16 06:45:55 frogprince said: Now I've just been memorizing a list of self-made snappy comebacks for the next time I get enough self-confidence up (soon) to start going to the public gym again. In the mean time, my puppy loves that she's getting extra long walks as my form of exercise.
2012-09-16 06:46:08 sabar said: Raggles dunno
2012-09-16 06:47:01 frogprince said: Even if someone who is heavy is eating a big Mac, I don't think they should be looked down on for it. I'm overweight, and I was treating myself to an ice cream once, because I hadn't had anything "treat" like in a week and it was hot and damn if I want an ice cream I should be able to eat it in peace.
2012-09-16 06:47:01 frogprince said: I had an old woman walk by me and attempt to knock it out of my hand saying "Fucking fat whores taking up all the seats on the bus so they can stuff their face."
2012-09-16 06:47:13 sabar said: I need to get a gun, and form a group with people who are in a same situation as me.. move into a commune and and we need to protect our self from this shit.. it's the only way imho
2012-09-16 06:47:42 frogprince said: sabar when will you go on a killing spree in finland

2012-09-16 06:49:53 Raggles said: he was afraid to come outside and meet at a corner
2012-09-16 06:50:04 Raggles said: because he didn't want people to know where he lived
2012-09-16 06:50:21 Raggles said: he's actually fucking crazy

2012-09-16 14:34:21 ferrum said: BradPitt: pretty much, yes. The key observation is that back angle is constant with respect to the floor, hip angle opens only by raising the hips
2012-09-16 14:34:56 BradPitt said: seems like cal strength lifters do this in their squats

2012-09-16 14:36:49 ferrum said: it just feels like your back is locked isometrically, extremely stable, not moving
2012-09-16 14:37:00 BradPitt said: hmm
2012-09-16 14:37:03 BradPitt said: i shall try this today

2012-09-16 14:39:01 ferrum said: olympic lifters (like, people at the olympics this year) were mostly squatting with knees caving
2012-09-16 14:39:15 ferrum said: appears to be a common thing in oly circles
2012-09-16 14:39:42 ferrum said: means they have weak adductors
2012-09-16 14:40:13 ferrum said: bbl, going to home depot to try to finish the glove.
2012-09-16 14:40:44 ferrum said: going to insert a 3" ABS pipe into the reducer
2012-09-16 14:40:56 BradPitt said: ill insert my 3" abs pipe
2012-09-16 14:41:01 ferrum said: it will make it extremely difficult to insert your hand, but it should mean that I can use a glove without stretching it as much
2012-09-16 14:41:12 ferrum said: which hopefully means that I can use a latex glove without it exploding again
2012-09-16 14:41:26 ferrum said: total cost of experimenting with this is like $25 :(

2012-09-16 21:44:25 BradPitt said: man
2012-09-16 21:44:31 BradPitt said: there are people in the world who snatch 200kg
2012-09-16 21:46:03 ferrum said: plan out your training, figure out how long it would take you to snatch 200kg based on current rate of improvement
2012-09-16 21:46:32 BradPitt said: TOO LONG'
2012-09-16 21:46:40 BradPitt said: i basically completely reset my snatch, cj and squat
2012-09-16 21:47:03 BradPitt said: because im re-learning technique and making my hamstrings/calves/glutes a priority
2012-09-16 21:47:36 BradPitt said: i was failing 40kg snatches
2012-09-16 21:48:11 BradPitt said: just because i still haven't found that "groove" for landing

2012-09-16 21:58:07 ferrum said: I could never figure out how that shit worked
2012-09-16 21:58:11 ferrum said: I tried it once and it hurt like all hell
2012-09-16 21:58:16 ferrum said: hurt worse than squats
2012-09-16 21:58:25 BradPitt said: yeah it fucking kills
2012-09-16 21:58:34 ferrum said: oh, it's supposed to do that?
2012-09-16 21:58:36 BradPitt said: i think that means i need to do it more
2012-09-16 21:58:39 ferrum said: normally when things hurt I stop doing them.
2012-09-16 21:58:53 BradPitt said: idk but i think if it hurts then you have too much compressed tissue in that area
2012-09-16 21:59:36 ferrum said: I'm trying to make a padded bra analogy but I'm only like 70% sure it can be made

2012-09-16 22:09:42 ferrum said: might switch to 3RMs
2012-09-16 22:10:08 ferrum said: I really don't like doing 5RMs with weight that feels like it's going to crush me

2012-09-16 22:11:26 Blice said: ferrum why do you always tell me there's no problem but you keep failing prs?
2012-09-16 22:11:37 BradPitt said: i like 3rms
2012-09-16 22:11:46 ferrum said: there's a problem, but it's not some fundamential thing
2012-09-16 22:12:05 ferrum said: I've been stuck at 445 for about a month now
2012-09-16 22:12:18 Blice said: drop your volume day down some ferrum
2012-09-16 22:12:21 Blice said: jeez
2012-09-16 22:12:24 ferrum said: actually two months
2012-09-16 22:12:29 ferrum said: and I got 445 cleanly two months ago
2012-09-16 22:12:54 Blice said: drop it down 5lb
2012-09-16 22:13:10 BradPitt said: ferrum how much was your singlet
2012-09-16 22:13:17 ferrum said: when I got it, I had 410 5x5, 445 1x5
2012-09-16 22:13:21 ferrum said: BradPitt: negligible
2012-09-16 22:13:32 BradPitt said: solid pricepoint
2012-09-16 22:13:38 Blice said: what're you doing right now?
2012-09-16 22:13:41 ferrum said: right now I have 415 5x5, 445 1x3
2012-09-16 22:13:49 ferrum said: possibly 1x4, I blame the music fuckup
2012-09-16 22:13:51 Blice said: too much weight on volume day
2012-09-16 22:14:07 sabarr said: crazy squat
2012-09-16 22:14:09 sabarr said: :D
2012-09-16 22:14:12 Blice said: i don't think you're recovering
2012-09-16 22:14:15 Blice said: for intensity day
2012-09-16 22:14:16 ferrum said: I might not be
2012-09-16 22:14:19 ferrum said: I have also been losing weight
2012-09-16 22:14:22 Blice said: o
2012-09-16 22:14:27 Blice said: thats also a problem
2012-09-16 22:14:29 ferrum said: yes
2012-09-16 22:14:34 Blice said: I htink you should go back to 410 5x5 and eat afterwards
2012-09-16 22:14:40 Blice said: and then reattempt 445
2012-09-16 22:14:46 Blice said: (1x5)
2012-09-16 22:15:10 sabarr said: :D
2012-09-16 22:15:11 ferrum said: I'm eating as much as I was before, I think caloric requirements are higher now
2012-09-16 22:15:25 ferrum said: yeah that's a reasonable strategy
2012-09-16 22:15:42 ferrum said: so far I have been trying to drive volume day to my limit as much as I can
2012-09-16 22:15:54 ferrum said: goal was always to increase volume day, and just hope that it increased intensity day
2012-09-16 22:15:57 Blice said: everything I've been reading has been saying you shouldn't do that
2012-09-16 22:16:01 Blice said: idk
2012-09-16 22:16:24 Blice said: I would go back to 410 5x5, eat/rest as well as you can, and if you make 445 1x5, do 410 5x5 again
2012-09-16 22:16:29 ferrum said: what if I dropped it to 405?
2012-09-16 22:16:29 Blice said: and then attempt 450 1x5
2012-09-16 22:16:42 Blice said: I don't think that's a bad idea either
2012-09-16 22:16:42 ferrum said: like, how are we arriving at 410 here other than with historical data
2012-09-16 22:16:47 Blice said: historical data
2012-09-16 22:17:11 Blice said: other than that 410 5x5 was a.) enough volume to drive adaptation before, and b.) recoverable before
2012-09-16 22:17:11 BradPitt said: is farting during a squat indicative of weak gluteal strength?
2012-09-16 22:17:13 BradPitt said: please respond
2012-09-16 22:17:22 ferrum said: it was a damn hard 5RM though
2012-09-16 22:17:25 ferrum said: I remember it
2012-09-16 22:17:38 Blice said: but you recovered and PRed
2012-09-16 22:17:41 ferrum said: BradPitt: it means that your sphincter can't fully close, because you've been sticking things up there
2012-09-16 22:17:47 BradPitt said: ;_;
2012-09-16 22:17:48 Blice said: did you make any other PRs off of that volume day before 445?
2012-09-16 22:17:49 ferrum said: (source: I am making stuff up)
2012-09-16 22:17:56 BradPitt said: im always scared im giong to fart
2012-09-16 22:18:05 BradPitt said: maybe i should take indigestion tablets before lifting
2012-09-16 22:18:24 ferrum said: Blice: no, I've always kept volume and intensity incrementing at the same rate
2012-09-16 22:18:25 Blice said: I mean did you do, 410 5x5, 435 1x5, 410 5x5, 440 1x5
2012-09-16 22:18:30 Blice said: ah
2012-09-16 22:18:34 Blice said: drop to 405
2012-09-16 22:18:44 Blice said: x_x
2012-09-16 22:18:53 ferrum said: 405 -> 440, 410 -> 445
2012-09-16 22:19:05 Blice said: actually
2012-09-16 22:19:06 Blice said: less even
2012-09-16 22:19:14 Blice said: maybe 400
2012-09-16 22:19:29 Blice said: 90% is always a good marker
2012-09-16 22:19:32 ferrum said: I can't do 445 now. You think that 405 will drive adaptation for 445, and the issue is just that I'm not recovering enough?
2012-09-16 22:19:49 Blice said: I think the issue is definitely you aren't recovering enough
2012-09-16 22:19:55 ferrum said: 415 is certainly enough of a stressor for 445, so the issue must only be recovery
2012-09-16 22:19:57 Blice said: you're doing more than the suggested volume to drive adaption
2012-09-16 22:20:06 ferrum said: right? check my logic here
2012-09-16 22:20:10 Blice said: the suggest volume for a 445 PR is 400 5x5
2012-09-16 22:20:21 Blice said: you're doing too much and not recovering
2012-09-16 22:20:33 ferrum said: alright, I'll drop to 405 and use the glove
2012-09-16 22:20:35 ferrum said: B)
2012-09-16 22:20:47 BradPitt said: inb4 power glove gives him otherwordly abilities
2012-09-16 22:21:03 ferrum said: inb4 I can't get water to the right temperature and the glove functions as the most expensive placebo ever
2012-09-16 22:21:05 Blice said: btw ferrum where did you get the idea to increase your volume day along with your intensity day like that?
2012-09-16 22:21:13 Blice said: just came to that conclusion or was it written somewhere?
2012-09-16 22:21:16 ferrum said: Blice: rippetoe's tnation article
2012-09-16 22:21:26 Blice said: that tnation article said 90%
2012-09-16 22:21:26 Blice said: no?
2012-09-16 22:21:27 ferrum said: http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/the_texas_method
2012-09-16 22:22:21 ferrum said: Blice: yes, I used his values at the start there
2012-09-16 22:23:01 Blice said: those values are indefinite
2012-09-16 22:23:05 Blice said: not just the starting values
2012-09-16 22:23:10 ferrum said: huh, it doesn't actually say to increase both. I guess I just could, so I did.
2012-09-16 22:23:23 ferrum said: I always thought that the more volume I'm able to do, the better adaptation I'm driving
2012-09-16 22:23:30 Blice said: I think practical programming was more specific about it
2012-09-16 22:23:34 ferrum said: so try to max volume, and use intensity day to measure
2012-09-16 22:23:42 Blice said: I mean I think it shows in the examples that you repeat the same volume days for a couple PRs
2012-09-16 22:23:45 Blice said: and its literally 90%
2012-09-16 22:24:11 ferrum said: OK, but I can do 415 5x5
2012-09-16 22:24:21 ferrum said: so shouldn't my 5RM be 460?
2012-09-16 22:24:27 Blice said: what you can do and what you can recover from are different
2012-09-16 22:24:59 ferrum said: there's some point at which I recover from it, though
2012-09-16 22:25:05 ferrum said: it's not like it doesn't produce an adaptation
2012-09-16 22:25:16 BradPitt said: >parents book flight without telling me
2012-09-16 22:25:22 BradPitt said: >email confirmation sent to my email for some reason
2012-09-16 22:25:24 Blice said: you aren't recovering from it in time for intensity though it seems
2012-09-16 22:25:25 BradPitt said: th-thanks
2012-09-16 22:25:25 Blice said: either way
2012-09-16 22:25:25 BradPitt said: ;_;
2012-09-16 22:25:35 Blice said: people say the most common error with texas method is too high volume day
2012-09-16 22:26:06 Blice said: and that implies that its not only possible to have "too high" a volume day but that it's a common problem
2012-09-16 22:26:31 Blice said: I wish I ddn't lend out my practical programming book or I would take a look
2012-09-16 22:26:35 Blice said: to make sure I did read it right
2012-09-16 22:26:36 ferrum said: I have it here

2012-09-16 22:28:27 ferrum said: "The reps each Friday do not have to be the same; it is quite useful to try for a max single, double, or triple on Friday, and rotate between all three."
2012-09-16 22:28:45 Blice said: we aren't interested in friday
2012-09-16 22:28:46 ferrum said: "When a program like this is started, the goal is to make progress on both Monday and Friday."
2012-09-16 22:28:59 ferrum said: "When all the prescribed sets and reps on Monday are accomplished, raise the weight for the next week."
2012-09-16 22:29:11 Blice said: when do you stop doing that
2012-09-16 22:29:16 Blice said: it says started
2012-09-16 22:29:29 ferrum said: "If a new 1RM is set Friday, next week try for a new 2RM. In essence, linear progress is still being made, but the line is now being drawn between Monday and Monday and between Friday and Friday."
2012-09-16 22:29:47 Blice said: also pls check the example sheets it gives for TM just to see if it keeps the same weight on any of the volume days
2012-09-16 22:30:03 ferrum said: "Very often, after several weeks of progress with personal records getting more difficult on Friday, the cycle can be sustained for a few more weeks with nothing more than a slight reduction in Monday's workload."
2012-09-16 22:30:17 Blice said: o
2012-09-16 22:30:29 ferrum said: "Cut back the number of sets, or even the weight on the bar a little, and progress on Friday's workout can usually be maintained."
2012-09-16 22:30:46 ferrum said: "The object is to make Monday's workout stressful enough to spur progress, but not so stressful that it interferes with Friday's PR."
2012-09-16 22:31:14 ferrum said: "It is always possible to exceed recovery ... Balance between the two must be achieved, or progress does not occur."
2012-09-16 22:31:53 ferrum said: ... "The intermediate phase of training, then, is the first opportunity for the serious misapplication of training variables that would result in an imbalance between stress and recovery."
2012-09-16 22:32:06 Blice said: :D :D :D
2012-09-16 22:32:26 Blice said: and so we get the point
2012-09-16 22:32:29 ferrum said: "The more advanced the trainee, the finer the line between not enough and too much."
2012-09-16 22:32:39 Blice said: drop the weight on monday to continue making progress
2012-09-16 22:32:53 ferrum said: thanks Blice

2012-09-16 22:39:19 ferrum said: that's how I got to 3plate
2012-09-16 22:39:27 ferrum said: I don't even remember whom I was competing with
2012-09-16 22:39:32 Blice said: and 4 plate
2012-09-16 22:39:39 ferrum said: 4plate was a yearly thing
2012-09-16 22:39:47 ferrum said: I wanted 300 before I left for CA, got it on the last day
2012-09-16 22:39:49 Blice said: o
2012-09-16 22:39:54 ferrum said: wanted 4plate under a year, got it on the last day
2012-09-16 22:39:59 Blice said: nice
2012-09-16 22:40:12 ferrum said: very stressful though
2012-09-16 22:40:21 ferrum said: kept thinking that if I didn't get it, I'd remember that for the rest of my life
2012-09-16 22:40:26 Blice said: yeah I bet
2012-09-16 22:40:42 Blice said: just racing this guy at work has been stressful
2012-09-16 22:40:50 Blice said: knowing that if I miss a PR that's it, I'm over
2012-09-16 22:40:52 Blice said: I lose
2012-09-16 22:41:05 Blice said: right now its stressful that if I miss a PR I won't be able to 315 with you
2012-09-16 22:41:06 Blice said: ;_;
2012-09-16 22:41:08 Blice said: that has to happen
2012-09-16 22:41:23 ferrum said: coworker I've been training is already squatting 195 3x5, beating another guy in the company who's been training for 3 years
2012-09-16 22:41:30 Blice said: haha
2012-09-16 22:41:33 ferrum said: that's the ferrum guarantee B)
2012-09-16 22:41:40 Blice said: that's what programming that makes sense will do
2012-09-16 22:41:42 Blice said: man
2012-09-16 22:41:46 Blice said: I can't stand people who make their own shit up
2012-09-16 22:41:58 Blice said: with no regard to the concept of stress, recovery, and over adaption
2012-09-16 22:41:58 ferrum said: that's why it's so fucking frustrating losing at bench to BradPitt
2012-09-16 22:42:02 ferrum said: he doesn't even know what he's doing
2012-09-16 22:42:07 Blice said: he has been benching for literally lke 5 years
2012-09-16 22:42:08 BradPitt said: wot
2012-09-16 22:42:09 BradPitt said: yes i do
2012-09-16 22:42:10 ferrum said: B)

2012-09-16 22:43:05 ferrum said: 160
2012-09-16 22:43:13 Blice said: ok I can beat that
2012-09-16 22:43:19 ferrum said: I got 170 as a 1RM, but it was shaky
2012-09-16 22:43:27 Blice said: PRed 140x3 today and it was so easy
2012-09-16 22:43:37 Blice said: I got another 15lb of PR in me for sure
2012-09-16 22:43:45 ferrum said: nice man
2012-09-16 22:43:51 BradPitt said: wtf dude China is going off
2012-09-16 22:43:55 ferrum said: when I started SS I got stalled at 115 for the longest time
2012-09-16 22:43:56 BradPitt said: Iran is going off
2012-09-16 22:43:58 BradPitt said: war is imminent
2012-09-16 22:43:59 ferrum said: BradPitt: yes, they're crazy.
2012-09-16 22:44:03 BradPitt said: we are going to get drafted guys
2012-09-16 22:44:03 ferrum said: Korea also
2012-09-16 22:44:04 BradPitt said: ;_;
2012-09-16 22:44:38 Blice said: yeah I lineared it up to 115x5 and then regressed to 95x5 on my cut
2012-09-16 22:44:43 Blice said: and then could never get it to go up again
2012-09-16 22:44:48 Blice said: so frustrating
2012-09-16 22:44:58 BradPitt said: >mfw ww3 and the draft is instated and blice wont have a chance to hit 315x5 on film and thus i wont have to pay him $100 and during ww3 my knee gets better even though im fighting and then we come back from the war as best war bros but i still beat blice to 315x5 even though the competition took well over 2 years to complete because of injuries and the war
2012-09-16 22:45:00 ferrum said: I forgot what I did to fix that
2012-09-16 22:45:04 Blice said: went to bill starr's 6x3 rep scheme and shot right the fuck up to 135x3x6
2012-09-16 22:45:08 Blice said: like magic
2012-09-16 22:45:33 ferrum said: I did that once at 155 6x3
2012-09-16 22:45:39 ferrum said: then couldn't even do 3 reps of 160 next time
2012-09-16 22:45:45 Blice said: thats how it goes
2012-09-16 22:45:53 ferrum said: 157.5?
2012-09-16 22:46:01 ferrum said: starr clearly said 5lbs should work
2012-09-16 22:46:01 Blice said: I did 125 6x3 easy and then failed 135 on the 3rd rep
2012-09-16 22:46:07 Blice said: and then next time I did 135 I got all sets
2012-09-16 22:46:08 Blice said: :>
2012-09-16 22:46:18 Blice said: you just keep doing it and the back off sets until you get all 6 and then you move on
2012-09-16 22:46:25 Blice said: one PR took me three goes
2012-09-16 22:46:35 Blice said: anyway now its 3 all the time so I'm switching to TM
2012-09-16 22:46:39 ferrum said: BradPitt has found hope
2012-09-16 22:46:46 Blice said: doing 8x3 and 1x3
2012-09-16 22:46:47 BradPitt said: :)
2012-09-16 22:48:19 Blice said: I did 120 8x3 wed, 105 2x3 fri, and 140 1x3 sun
2012-09-16 22:48:33 Blice said: next week doing 120 8x3 again, 105 2x3 again, and then 145 1x3
2012-09-16 22:48:39 ferrum said: get a belt
2012-09-16 22:48:42 ferrum said: your press will go up
2012-09-16 22:48:50 ferrum said: you can't possibly even object to that
2012-09-16 22:48:50 Blice said: I think I'm going to do 10lb PR off each volume set
2012-09-16 22:49:13 Blice said: ugh man I don't want to get a belt
2012-09-16 22:49:13 Blice said: D:

2012-09-16 22:49:17 Blice said: idk
2012-09-16 22:49:25 Blice said: what a hasstle it must be to put on and take off a belt
2012-09-16 22:49:40 ferrum said: get a lever belt
2012-09-16 22:49:48 ferrum said: putting on -> 1 second, taking off -> 1 second
2012-09-16 22:49:52 ferrum said: it's the easiest thing ever
2012-09-16 22:50:04 ferrum said: you just flick the lever and all pressure is released (or added)
2012-09-16 22:50:30 Blice said: the first time I fail an intensity day for press I will buy a belt.
2012-09-16 22:50:47 ferrum said: 10mm 4" inzer lever belt
2012-09-16 22:51:25 Blice said: I thought 3" was where its at
2012-09-16 22:51:34 ferrum said: I bought one but never used it
2012-09-16 22:51:40 ferrum said: it feels weird
2012-09-16 22:51:44 Blice said: o
2012-09-16 22:51:57 ferrum said: thought it would be useful on DLs, but it's just sucky
2012-09-16 22:52:12 ferrum said: there's also no 3" lever, so it's a pain in the ass to put on and take off
2012-09-16 22:52:48 Blice said: how much did your 4" cost?
2012-09-16 22:56:26 ferrum said: http://www.inzernet.com/detail_belt.asp?PRODUCT_ID=FOREVER_LEVER_10MM

2012-09-16 22:57:45 Blice said: so what's going on with china
2012-09-16 22:57:58 Blice said: checked bbc just saw some shit about anti japanese protests
2012-09-16 22:58:20 ferrum said: Blice: chinese government sponsored massive anti-japanese protests in all major cities in china
2012-09-16 22:58:42 ferrum said: people are destroying japanese things, burning japanese stores, threatening to kill japanese people, refusing them entry in businesses
2012-09-16 22:58:57 Blice said: oh
2012-09-16 22:58:57 Blice said: fun
2012-09-16 22:59:00 ferrum said: because China claims ownership of small islands that belong to Japan
2012-09-16 22:59:08 Blice said: conflicts between japan and china always end up great
2012-09-16 22:59:21 ferrum said: protests are huge because they're government-sponsored
2012-09-16 22:59:27 Blice said: yeah
2012-09-16 22:59:39 Blice said: what is korea and iran's role? BradPitt mentioend them
2012-09-16 22:59:48 BradPitt said: well
2012-09-16 22:59:50 ferrum said: korea is also pissed at japan, about different islands
2012-09-16 22:59:50 BradPitt said: muslims rather
2012-09-16 22:59:55 BradPitt said: muslims are mad over the video
2012-09-16 22:59:58 ferrum said: iran is unrelated to this mess, but is iran
2012-09-16 23:00:08 Blice said: oh
2012-09-16 23:00:14 BradPitt said: and radical extremists are using it as an excuse to going apeshit
2012-09-16 23:00:57 ferrum said: as opposed to reasonable extremists
2012-09-16 23:02:17 BradPitt said: yes
2012-09-16 23:02:31 BradPitt said: ALLAH AKBAR but yes I respect you and your catholic beliefs
2012-09-16 23:05:21 Blice said: lol
2012-09-16 23:05:59 BradPitt said: man what if ww3 happened
2012-09-16 23:06:00 BradPitt said: fuarg
2012-09-16 23:06:01 BradPitt said: :DD:D
2012-09-16 23:06:02 ferrum said: augh, my neck is so stiff from playing video games all weekend
2012-09-16 23:06:20 sabarr said: if ww3 happens, I'm coming to america
2012-09-16 23:06:28 sabarr said: no way I'm going to fight in a war
2012-09-16 23:06:32 sabarr said: I'm too smart for that
2012-09-16 23:07:40 ferrum said: sabar's a lover, not a fighter
2012-09-16 23:08:05 sabarr said: yes
2012-09-16 23:09:07 BradPitt said: people in america will have to fight
2012-09-16 23:09:55 sabarr said: yeah but it's not compulsory
2012-09-16 23:10:59 sabarr said: I made a military oath
2012-09-16 23:11:07 sabarr said: if I say fuck war I might get executed
2012-09-16 23:11:14 BradPitt said: its mandatory to join the reserve
2012-09-16 23:11:18 BradPitt said: you can be fined up to $100k
2012-09-16 23:11:29 sabarr said: really
2012-09-16 23:11:30 sabarr said: lol
2012-09-16 23:11:33 sabarr said: that sucks
2012-09-16 23:11:35 BradPitt said: yeah
2012-09-16 23:12:22 sabarr said: I hate how they can force people to fight in wars
2012-09-16 23:13:06 Blice said: there would be no army otherwise sabarr
2012-09-16 23:13:12 Blice said: it isn't people who want wars, its governments
2012-09-16 23:13:19 Blice said: people never want war
2012-09-16 23:16:31 Blice said: except for maybe a small group
2012-09-16 23:16:44 sabarr said: yes
2012-09-16 23:16:48 sabarr said: it's terrible
2012-09-16 23:16:56 Blice said: im not saying wars are always bad, just that people will always chose their comfortable life over a risky change
2012-09-16 23:16:59 sabarr said: goverment should have no right to wage wars
2012-09-16 23:17:06 Blice said: take the civil war for example in the US
2012-09-16 23:17:11 sabarr said: it should be voted
2012-09-16 23:17:12 Blice said: sure there were some groups of people who wanted to fight
2012-09-16 23:17:18 Blice said: but for the most part no one wanted war
2012-09-16 23:17:23 Blice said: but the governments drafted
2012-09-16 23:17:25 Blice said: and that's just how it is
2012-09-16 23:17:35 sabarr said: yes
2012-09-16 23:17:49 Blice said: or the US against the british claiming independence
2012-09-16 23:17:54 Blice said: it was overall better for the people right
2012-09-16 23:18:03 Blice said: but I'm sure again most people didn't want to fight
2012-09-16 23:18:25 Blice said: they would have rather continued to pay their taxes to the main land and stay comfortable with their families with the bread they could afford
2012-09-16 23:18:56 sabarr said: or when russians attacked finland
2012-09-16 23:18:58 Blice said: but yeah, wars should be voted on
2012-09-16 23:19:04 sabarr said: in ww2
2012-09-16 23:19:05 Blice said: and everyone who votes yes should be drafted
2012-09-16 23:19:06 Blice said: ;)
2012-09-16 23:19:09 sabarr said: we would be so fucking poor atm
2012-09-16 23:19:26 sabarr said: and in the other hand because russia attacked we are rich
2012-09-16 23:19:38 sabarr said: cause we had to make shit loads of industry to pay for russians
2012-09-16 23:19:43 sabarr said: 2 bladed sword
2012-09-16 23:19:53 sabarr said: or edged sward
2012-09-16 23:19:56 sabarr said: sword
2012-09-16 23:19:58 sabarr said: how to say
2012-09-16 23:20:27 sabarr said: Blice that would be great idea
2012-09-16 23:20:49 BradPitt said: i require nutrients
2012-09-16 23:21:34 Blice said: it wasn't my idea sabarr a lot of people think it would be a good thing to do
2012-09-16 23:21:36 Blice said: it just makes sense
2012-09-16 23:21:51 Blice said: if you aren't willing to fight the war you shouldn't be allowed to support it
2012-09-16 23:21:58 Blice said: I mean legally
2012-09-16 23:22:05 Blice said: you can say what you want but you shouldn't be able to vote for it
2012-09-16 23:22:56 sabarr said: I can be in a factory tho but no way I could keep my head straight in fire fight.. army got me scared
2012-09-16 23:23:21 sabarr said: watching all those hardcore fire fight videos
2012-09-16 23:23:32 sabarr said: where people got their brains blown out
2012-09-16 23:23:39 sabarr said: childrends died in chemical attacks
2012-09-16 23:23:43 sabarr said: god that was horrible
2012-09-16 23:24:50 Blice said: fugg
2012-09-16 23:25:25 sabarr said: I mean.. you don't realise it's real
2012-09-16 23:25:30 sabarr said: if you watch it in news
2012-09-16 23:25:34 sabarr said: or play video games
2012-09-16 23:25:58 sabarr said: but when you actually sit in military academy auditorium and watch war videos
2012-09-16 23:26:01 sabarr said: then it really hits you
2012-09-16 23:26:17 Blice said: yeah fuck that
2012-09-16 23:27:16 sabarr said: and reality is in total war average life span is about 5-10 seconds
2012-09-16 23:27:46 sabarr said: when you being bombed, artillery shoot at you, tanks, machine guns riffles
2012-09-16 23:27:54 sabarr said: etc
2012-09-16 23:28:26 sabarr said: you shoot back with same kind of fire power
2012-09-16 23:29:05 sabarr said: guns are so fucking powerfull these days it's just fucking madness
2012-09-16 23:29:15 BradPitt said: yeah you fire back with love
2012-09-16 23:33:52 ferrum said: then when they're distracted by the love you shoot them in the face
2012-09-16 23:35:01 BradPitt said: :}
2012-09-16 23:36:57 sabarr said: :D
2012-09-16 23:37:45 ferrum said: I really like Rippetoe. I want a version of him to follow me around, spouting things about libertarianism and government regulations.
2012-09-16 23:39:03 Blice said: haha
2012-09-16 23:39:08 Blice said: I like him only sometimes
2012-09-16 23:39:15 Blice said: sometimes he is too agressive
2012-09-16 23:39:21 Blice said: but I guess all strong personalities are
2012-09-16 23:39:24 Blice said: myself included
2012-09-16 23:39:49 sabarr said: time to go
2012-09-16 23:39:52 ferrum said: he doesn't argue well, if he can't make a point logically but knows something is true, he'll just tell the other party to shut the fuck up and come back when he has more life experience
2012-09-16 23:40:03 ferrum said: which is a shame because he's usually right
2012-09-16 23:40:25 Blice said: he was raised much differently too
2012-09-16 23:40:33 Blice said: er
2012-09-16 23:40:35 Blice said: what I mean is
2012-09-16 23:40:38 Blice said: people in texas are different
2012-09-16 23:40:45 Blice said: they argue differently and treat each other differently
2012-09-16 23:41:01 Blice said: his kind of texas anyway
2012-09-16 23:41:23 Blice said: I disagree with him on a couple things
2012-09-16 23:41:38 Blice said: positioning for the first pull on the snatch and clean & jerk
2012-09-16 23:41:51 Blice said: he thinks a straight bar path is best
2012-09-16 23:42:01 Blice said: but the best path is the one that sets you up for the most efficient 2nd pull
2012-09-16 23:42:19 Blice said: it just is
2012-09-16 23:42:24 ferrum said: his argument is just that a straight bar path constitutes less work from the physics perspective
2012-09-16 23:42:36 ferrum said: completely discounting anatomy or anything
2012-09-16 23:43:06 Blice said: yeah but even if that was true (it is mostly) they aren't worried about an efficient first pull
2012-09-16 23:43:21 Blice said: it just doesn't matter if they have to put more effort into the first pull because they can deadlift much more than that ,it doesn't matter
2012-09-16 23:43:29 Blice said: picking it up from the ground isn't the part that's hard
2012-09-16 23:43:37 Blice said: idk
2012-09-16 23:43:39 ferrum said: pretty sure he's talking about the quick part
2012-09-16 23:43:47 ferrum said: most people tend to lift vertically
2012-09-16 23:43:57 ferrum said: but then they do that pelvic thrust thing, and the bar goes forward
2012-09-16 23:43:58 Blice said: oh
2012-09-16 23:44:02 Blice said: he's talking about the scoop?
2012-09-16 23:44:03 Blice said: right
2012-09-16 23:44:28 Blice said: ferrum: have you tried cleaning both ways?
2012-09-16 23:44:32 ferrum said: "both ways"?
2012-09-16 23:44:41 Blice said: yeah in the 2nd pull
2012-09-16 23:44:47 ferrum said: oh, no, I never do oly things.
2012-09-16 23:45:00 Blice said: thought you did power cleans sometimes?

2012-09-16 23:55:24 ferrum said: bench regressed 225 -> 210
2012-09-16 23:55:33 ferrum said: which is... suspicious, because I don't think that's actually possible
2012-09-16 23:55:58 Blice said: im glad your bench and ohp are close enough that I can aspire to catch up and be competitive
2012-09-16 23:56:10 Blice said: PRed 185x5 bench
2012-09-16 23:56:16 ferrum said: I'm really shit at bench :P
2012-09-16 23:57:21 Blice said: also I though you never got 225 for 4
2012-09-16 23:57:23 Blice said: 5*
2012-09-16 23:57:25 Blice said: just for 1 or 3 or something
2012-09-16 23:57:46 ferrum said: yeah for 3
2012-09-16 23:57:50 ferrum said: I just got 210 for 3
2012-09-16 23:57:57 ferrum said: or 2, actually
2012-09-16 23:57:59 ferrum said: 210x2
2012-09-16 23:58:24 BradPitt said: :D
2012-09-17 00:01:48 ferrum said: alright, there's no way the water reservoir is fitting in my backpack
2012-09-17 00:01:49 ferrum said: ideas
2012-09-17 00:02:21 ferrum said: everything else fits -- chalk, shoes, belt, singlet, tshirt, weights, glove, tubing, vacuum pump, water pump
2012-09-17 00:02:50 ferrum said: best would be something at google that can hold water that's dependable to be there, so I wouldn't have to transport it
2012-09-17 00:03:22 ferrum said: alternatively, it looks like I can transport the water reservoir if I omit shoes.
2012-09-17 00:03:45 ferrum said: some foldable plastic thing with metal supports, maybe...
2012-09-17 00:04:01 ferrum said: like four metal |X| beams
2012-09-17 00:04:13 ferrum said: and the X part is foldable so that the upper angle can close
2012-09-17 00:05:07 BradPitt said: dude
2012-09-17 00:05:10 BradPitt said: just fucking use your piss

2012-09-17 00:05:43 ferrum said: you're saying insert a catheter?
2012-09-17 00:05:49 ferrum said: fuck, then I don't even need the pump! wasted money
2012-09-17 00:10:22 ferrum said: OK, I worked out a way to transport everything.
2012-09-17 00:10:35 ferrum said: this is fishy as hell, and I hope my shoes don't fly off while I'm riding.
2012-09-17 00:11:41 beavymeister said: rip a toe
2012-09-17 00:11:46 beavymeister said: ripe a toe ?
2012-09-17 00:12:54 ferrum said: everything is so tightly jam-packed that I think I've hit the limit
2012-09-17 00:13:04 ferrum said: but I'll actually be able to test it tomorrow :D:D:D:D:D
2012-09-17 00:16:32 BradPitt said: why dont you test it now

2012-09-17 00:17:05 ferrum said: I already tested it with DDR
2012-09-17 00:17:21 ferrum said: it felt amazing
2012-09-17 00:17:33 ferrum said: also the seal is now good enough that it's very easy to maintain

2012-09-17 16:51:47 BradPitt said: i love how he still posts on /fit/
2012-09-17 16:51:56 BradPitt said: it doesnt transfer as well as highbar

2012-09-17 16:52:16 Blice said: good fad
2012-09-17 16:52:41 Blice said: BradPitt where is the data on that
2012-09-17 16:52:46 Blice said: please
2012-09-17 16:52:51 BradPitt said: on what
2012-09-17 16:52:56 BradPitt said: highbar vs lowbar?
2012-09-17 16:53:03 Blice said: link to data showing transfer rate of low bar vs. high bar to the snatch and clean & jerk
2012-09-17 16:53:07 Blice said: yes
2012-09-17 16:53:08 Blice said: where is the data
2012-09-17 16:53:11 Blice said: otherwise its just broscience
2012-09-17 16:53:28 BradPitt said: i dont have empirical data, but all major oly coaches suggest high bar
2012-09-17 16:53:29 Blice said: either way front squat contributes to the clean and snatch more than high bar does, so why do you bother high barring?
2012-09-17 16:53:39 BradPitt said: since it is the same position as the first pull and reception during cleans
2012-09-17 16:53:47 Blice said: oh yeah because its a better strength builder than front squats
2012-09-17 16:54:17 BradPitt said: it encourages you to sit back on your heels and keep a strong, tight chest and upper back
2012-09-17 16:54:21 BradPitt said: which is what you want on oly lifts
2012-09-17 16:54:24 Blice said: BradPitt face it, the high bar montra is based on tradition
2012-09-17 16:54:35 BradPitt said: well, all oly lifts I see do high bar
2012-09-17 16:54:39 BradPitt said: all oly coaches preach high bar
2012-09-17 16:54:41 Blice said: because of tradition
2012-09-17 16:54:42 BradPitt said: so i will stick with high bar
2012-09-17 16:54:51 Blice said: I think you should know how to use both
2012-09-17 16:55:04 Blice said: there are people who build strength with low bar
2012-09-17 16:55:26 Blice said: BradPitt why can't you think the logic through yourself
2012-09-17 16:55:49 BradPitt said: but its not just about strength
2012-09-17 16:56:00 BradPitt said: its about teaching comfortability in certain positions
2012-09-17 16:56:05 Blice said: dude
2012-09-17 16:56:12 Blice said: that matters for a beginnner
2012-09-17 16:56:25 BradPitt said: it matters at all levels
2012-09-17 16:56:26 Blice said: an advanced oly lifter isn't going to benefit from "learning to be more comfortable"
2012-09-17 16:56:32 BradPitt said: yes they will
2012-09-17 16:56:41 BradPitt said: you are always trying to advance in weight
2012-09-17 16:56:48 BradPitt said: and you want to be comfortable at all weights
2012-09-17 16:56:57 Blice said: >always trying to advance in weight
2012-09-17 16:57:01 Blice said: yeah it's called strength
2012-09-17 16:57:10 BradPitt said: oly lifting isnt just about strength though
2012-09-17 16:57:19 Blice said: it is at the higher levels of competition
2012-09-17 16:57:21 Blice said: eg the olympics
2012-09-17 16:57:36 BradPitt said: there are SO many more factors at that level
2012-09-17 16:57:41 BradPitt said: and neither of us can comment on it
2012-09-17 16:57:56 Blice said: if you say so
2012-09-17 16:58:04 BradPitt said: peptides, steroids, etc
2012-09-17 16:58:11 Blice said: which do what BradPitt q
2012-09-17 16:58:14 Blice said: what do the steroids do
2012-09-17 16:58:16 Blice said: for the lifter
2012-09-17 16:58:19 BradPitt said: strength
2012-09-17 16:58:22 BradPitt said: but
2012-09-17 16:58:24 Blice said: ok
2012-09-17 16:58:25 BradPitt said: you can't just have raw strength
2012-09-17 16:58:26 Blice said: cool
2012-09-17 16:58:28 BradPitt said: and be the best oly lifter
2012-09-17 16:58:30 Blice said: you're being dumb
2012-09-17 16:58:35 BradPitt said: how?
2012-09-17 16:58:40 BradPitt said: raw strength != best oly lifter
2012-09-17 16:58:41 ferrum said: by the way, this argument has been happening for many months on the SS forums
2012-09-17 16:58:42 Blice said: "other countries win because of steroids but strength isn't the issue"
2012-09-17 16:58:43 BradPitt said: or even a good oly lifter
2012-09-17 16:58:47 Blice said: I know ferrum
2012-09-17 16:58:51 ferrum said: with rippetoe taking Blice's side, and random people taking BradPitt's
2012-09-17 16:58:52 BradPitt said: i never said that blice
2012-09-17 16:59:15 ferrum said: BradPitt: form work is form work, strength work is separate
2012-09-17 16:59:37 BradPitt said: well i think the more time you spend in that high bar position, the better
2012-09-17 16:59:37 Blice said: it's a fucking strength sport
2012-09-17 16:59:48 BradPitt said: oly is more more technique oriented though
2012-09-17 16:59:57 BradPitt said: speed, catch, bar path, etc
2012-09-17 16:59:57 Blice said: its like talking to a wall
2012-09-17 17:00:00 BradPitt said: can all add or remove kilos
2012-09-17 17:00:14 Blice said: sorry but lu xaiojun doesn't work on his fucking bar path
2012-09-17 17:00:18 ferrum said: BradPitt: suppose that two lifters have the same form. The stronger one will win, right?
2012-09-17 17:00:18 BradPitt said: ...
2012-09-17 17:00:24 BradPitt said: blice no way you honestly think that
2012-09-17 17:00:32 BradPitt said: yes ferrum, all else equal
2012-09-17 17:00:33 Blice said: he has been snatching like his whole life
2012-09-17 17:00:41 Blice said: he doesn't need to practice form he needs to set PRs
2012-09-17 17:00:42 Blice said: which he does
2012-09-17 17:00:51 BradPitt said: he practices form every day he trains
2012-09-17 17:00:55 ferrum said: BradPitt: so how much do you think low-bar squatting would detract from your form, and how much do you think it would add to your strength?
2012-09-17 17:01:03 ferrum said: that's really the question here
2012-09-17 17:01:06 BradPitt said: i don't know
2012-09-17 17:01:09 BradPitt said: there is no way to tell
2012-09-17 17:01:09 Blice said: I think you're confusing doing the lift wiht practicing form
2012-09-17 17:01:11 BradPitt said: unless i do it
2012-09-17 17:01:17 ferrum said: I would propose -- not much to form, very much to strength
2012-09-17 17:01:22 Blice said: ferrum
2012-09-17 17:01:27 BradPitt said: except at PR or near-PR levels, you should always be paying attention to form
2012-09-17 17:01:28 Blice said: he's just reciting what he's heard
2012-09-17 17:01:29 Blice said: he doesn't know
2012-09-17 17:01:35 Blice said: he doesn't take the time to understand anything
2012-09-17 17:01:49 BradPitt said: just because i refute a point doesn't mean I "dont take time to understand anything"
2012-09-17 17:01:54 ferrum said: well sport specificity is real
2012-09-17 17:01:57 BradPitt said: i just dont want to switch to lowbar
2012-09-17 17:02:08 ferrum said: so if we were telling him to do leg presses, he's right to say what he does
2012-09-17 17:02:33 BradPitt said: all of the greatest oly lifters squat high bar
2012-09-17 17:02:42 BradPitt said: im sure i will be fine if i continue to squat high bar
2012-09-17 17:03:02 Blice said: high bar is good accessory work because it directly targets the STRENGTH of the muscles used for the clean and snatch more than the low bar. Low bar will increase general strength and will make a better first pull
2012-09-17 17:03:11 Blice said: but it isn't an issue of form
2012-09-17 17:03:45 Blice said: I mean it's not like you're going to do some low bar squatting and now your form is bad on the lifts
2012-09-17 17:03:53 BradPitt said: no
2012-09-17 17:04:04 BradPitt said: but I think the more familiar you are in that high bar position, the better
2012-09-17 17:04:10 ferrum said: I think his logic is "I understand the argument but feel safer sticking to the route with historical precedent"
2012-09-17 17:04:10 BradPitt said: ESPECIALLY if you're just starting out
2012-09-17 17:04:14 Blice said: you're never in the high bar position in either of the lifts
2012-09-17 17:04:20 Blice said: I think you mean to say the more familiar you are in a front squat..
2012-09-17 17:04:32 BradPitt said: by "high bar position" i mean chest up, back vertical
2012-09-17 17:04:40 BradPitt said: knees out
2012-09-17 17:04:41 BradPitt said: etc
2012-09-17 17:04:46 ferrum said: and usually touching ;)
2012-09-17 17:04:47 Blice said: you can spend lots of time like that while snatching and clean & jerking
2012-09-17 17:04:50 Blice said: and front squatting
2012-09-17 17:04:57 BradPitt said: and even more while high bar squatting
2012-09-17 17:05:31 BradPitt said: ultimately im not concerned with squat numbers anyways
2012-09-17 17:05:37 BradPitt said: since i wont be competing in squat
2012-09-17 17:05:52 Blice said: you should be concerned with squat numbers
2012-09-17 17:06:08 BradPitt said: i should be concerned with learning proper form and building from that
2012-09-17 17:06:21 Blice said: wellyeah
2012-09-17 17:06:24 ferrum said: BradPitt: do you think that if I started doing oly stuff, I'd be better than you, coming from a huge strength base?
2012-09-17 17:06:28 Blice said: learning how to do a movement is vital to doing the movement
2012-09-17 17:06:38 BradPitt said: depends on how fast you can learn the lifts, ferrum
2012-09-17 17:06:45 ferrum said: greg everett is right next door B)
2012-09-17 17:06:52 Blice said: get his book first ferrum

2012-09-17 17:06:55 Blice said: it's a good book
2012-09-17 17:07:10 ferrum said: BradPitt: I mean, let's plan what you'll do in the next year
2012-09-17 17:07:28 ferrum said: BradPitt: at your current rate, what'll your c&j be? what if you stopped doing that and got your squat to 405?
2012-09-17 17:07:45 BradPitt said: idk i havent been focusing on progression
2012-09-17 17:07:50 ferrum said: :|

2012-09-17 17:08:02 ferrum said: lol
2012-09-17 17:08:07 BradPitt said: so i dont know when i will be adding weight to the bar
2012-09-17 17:08:23 Blice said: ferrum don't bother
2012-09-17 17:08:28 Blice said: but srs
2012-09-17 17:08:30 BradPitt said: also oly lifts dont progress like other lifts when you start out
2012-09-17 17:08:31 Blice said: after you finish your first meet
2012-09-17 17:08:32 Blice said: set some record
2012-09-17 17:08:34 Blice said: you should get into oly
2012-09-17 17:08:41 ferrum said: not going to the meet I think
2012-09-17 17:08:45 BradPitt said: since technique will determine a lot
2012-09-17 17:08:49 ferrum said: also not going into oly

2012-09-17 17:09:07 Blice said: lol
2012-09-17 17:10:06 ferrum said: powerlifting just strikes me as a better sport
2012-09-17 17:10:13 ferrum said: you can grind out reps, it's a real test of determination
2012-09-17 17:10:30 ferrum said: oly lifting is just like a second of a very powerful flick, and then it's all silly form things
2012-09-17 17:10:32 Blice said: I like that form is a bit more important in oly lifting
2012-09-17 17:10:39 Blice said: you can't fail a squat 5 times and then make it
2012-09-17 17:10:44 ferrum said: manliness to me isn't proportional to silly form things
2012-09-17 17:10:45 Blice said: like you can with a snatch or w/e
2012-09-17 17:11:02 Blice said: welp

2012-09-17 22:42:14 ferrum said: good evening, men
2012-09-17 22:42:20 ferrum said: I have anecdotal data from glove use.
2012-09-17 22:44:45 Blice said: :D
2012-09-17 22:44:48 Blice said: data pls
2012-09-17 22:44:51 ferrum said: squats appear to be wholly unaffected -- incidentally, 405 5x5 this week was equally or slightly more difficult than 415 5x5 last week. Extremely tired, nearly failed. Probably from deadlifting on Friday.
2012-09-17 22:45:24 ferrum said: on the other hand, overhead press is /significantly/ helped by the glove. I did 160 6x3 with absolutely no problem, and every set felt /exactly/ like the first. No fatigue whatsoever.
2012-09-17 22:45:51 ferrum said: followed immediately by 140x7. If you know my history, this is /way/ much of an increase.
2012-09-17 22:46:14 Blice said: perfect
2012-09-17 22:46:16 ferrum said: this matches the data that stanford reported -- they published results for pullups, pushups, and bench press, all of which are obviously upper-body exercises.
2012-09-17 22:46:20 Blice said: good news about the ohp
2012-09-17 22:46:25 ferrum said: squats can probably be helped with a foot bath or something.
2012-09-17 22:46:32 Blice said: foot glove
2012-09-17 22:46:39 ferrum said: if I make that, I can probably patent it.
2012-09-17 22:46:41 ferrum said: :)
2012-09-17 22:46:56 Blice said: 8)
2012-09-17 22:47:06 Blice said: im not surprised that 405 was hard
2012-09-17 22:47:12 Blice said: rest hard bruv
2012-09-17 22:47:23 ferrum said: I am, it was harder than 415
2012-09-17 22:48:01 ferrum said: but it's good to know that the problem is residual fatigue, that I'm not recovering on the weekly basis
2012-09-17 22:48:12 ferrum said: I'll try to fix that with food, but taking a week off to let fatigue pass might be necessary
2012-09-17 22:48:23 Blice said: not off
2012-09-17 22:48:25 Blice said: 80%
2012-09-17 22:48:29 Blice said: errthing 80%

2012-09-17 22:48:45 ferrum said: yeah, 80% is off :P
2012-09-17 22:49:04 Blice said: fuck it'll be ohp recovery day when I visit
2012-09-17 22:49:09 Blice said: tfw I won't use magic glove
2012-09-17 22:49:30 ferrum said: that might be for the best, it's configured for my wrist size
2012-09-17 22:49:34 ferrum said: you likely have much larger wrists
2012-09-17 22:49:42 ferrum said: can change it, but it's a hassle
2012-09-17 22:49:47 ferrum said: involves screwdrivers and shit >_>
2012-09-17 22:50:02 ferrum said: did I mention 160 6x3 ohp?
2012-09-17 22:50:05 Blice said: yeah
2012-09-17 22:50:09 Blice said: I am really stoked about that
2012-09-17 22:50:13 ferrum said: I just took this ohp game to a whole nother level
2012-09-17 22:50:15 Blice said: maybe
2012-09-17 22:50:16 ferrum said: step yo' game up
2012-09-17 22:50:40 Blice said: the next question is, if you push your body past the normal limits artificially, that is, bypass the safety mechanisms, will your body recover enough to make progress?
2012-09-17 22:50:47 Blice said: or will it be like your over volumed squats
2012-09-17 22:51:02 Blice said: excited to fin dout
2012-09-17 22:51:04 Blice said: :3

2012-09-17 22:51:18 Blice said: that's different
2012-09-17 22:51:28 ferrum said: ''better than steroids'' -- everybody ever
2012-09-17 22:51:35 Blice said: steroids help the recovery afterwards not inbetween sets

2012-09-17 22:53:17 Blice said: the other thing is that when I switched to bill starr I improved only at first like Failure, Success, Failure, Success,
2012-09-17 22:53:21 Blice said: and you just had a failure
2012-09-17 22:53:37 ferrum said: uh, if you remember the last time I pressed, it was 160@1x1f
2012-09-17 22:53:39 Blice said: you're doing weights much higher than me but
2012-09-17 22:53:48 ferrum said: 160@6x3 is way better than 160@1x1f :P
2012-09-17 22:53:49 Blice said: I thought you got a 2nd rep in
2012-09-17 22:53:51 ferrum said: nope

2012-09-17 22:56:13 Blice said: that's true
2012-09-17 22:56:17 BradPitt|laptop said: next: full body suit
2012-09-17 22:56:23 ferrum said: next is foot bath, I think
2012-09-17 22:56:27 Blice said: you're at google so you can pretend its real research
2012-09-17 22:56:30 ferrum said: they're going to fucking hate me
2012-09-17 22:56:37 ferrum said: vacuum foot bath.
2012-09-17 22:56:42 Blice said: foot glove
2012-09-17 22:56:45 ferrum said: (probably without the vacuum.)
2012-09-17 22:56:47 Blice said: then you need to shave your head
2012-09-17 22:56:48 BradPitt|laptop said: is it loud?
2012-09-17 22:56:52 Blice said: and do the head spot too
2012-09-17 22:56:53 ferrum said: no, it's inaudible
2012-09-17 22:56:56 BradPitt|laptop said: oh, nice
2012-09-17 22:56:57 ferrum said: I used an aquarium pump
2012-09-17 22:57:20 ferrum said: I have a bunch of leftover materials; I could seriously make a foot glove
2012-09-17 22:57:41 BradPitt|laptop said: its just a matter of switching out the glove insert, right?
2012-09-17 22:57:47 ferrum said: for what
2012-09-17 22:57:52 BradPitt|laptop said: for the pump
2012-09-17 22:58:04 ferrum said: not sure I follow
2012-09-17 22:58:16 BradPitt|laptop said: im imagining a pump with a glove connected to it
2012-09-17 22:58:18 BradPitt|laptop said: correct?
2012-09-17 22:58:25 ferrum said: pump sits in the water reservoir and is connected via plastic tubing to the nubs on the outside of the brass nipple
2012-09-17 22:58:25 _VIPPER_ said: yes
2012-09-17 22:58:37 Blice said: _VIPPER_ knows, clearly
2012-09-17 22:58:47 ferrum said: BradPitt|laptop: no, pump is totally separate, other than that it pumps water through plastic tubing into the brass nipple inside the glove.
2012-09-17 22:59:09 BradPitt|laptop said: okay but basically to make it "foot compatable" you just have to switch out the glove for a foot sleeve
2012-09-17 22:59:12 BradPitt|laptop said: or something
2012-09-17 23:00:03 ferrum said: no foot glove would be totally different design
2012-09-17 23:00:16 ferrum said: the hand glove has a pipe that you grab with your hand, but you can't grab a pipe with your foot
2012-09-17 23:00:29 ferrum said: it would need to be a cold, contoured plate under which water runs
2012-09-17 23:00:48 ferrum said: pretty sure a footbath would be sufficient though >_>
2012-09-17 23:01:02 ferrum said: I'd try the easy solution first before I go out building yet another thing
2012-09-17 23:01:09 ferrum said: this was fun to build, but once is enough for me
2012-09-17 23:01:15 Blice said: yeah a foot bath with regulated temp
2012-09-17 23:01:54 BradPitt|laptop said: why not like a heatsink design
2012-09-17 23:01:59 BradPitt|laptop said: an upside down heatsink
2012-09-17 23:02:04 BradPitt|laptop said: s/heatsink/waterblock
2012-09-17 23:02:07 ferrum said: why not a snowman that hugs you
2012-09-17 23:02:12 BradPitt|laptop said: or that
2012-09-17 23:02:22 ferrum said: patenting that shit
2012-09-17 23:03:45 ferrum said: no for a foot glove I'd imagine contoured copper lining
2012-09-17 23:04:04 ferrum said: underneath the lining water can flow, and there are in/out barbs
2012-09-17 23:06:38 BradPitt|laptop said: that is exactly what a waterblock is
2012-09-17 23:06:51 ferrum said: url?
2012-09-17 23:07:03 Blice said: http://www.google.com
2012-09-17 23:07:13 ferrum said: if I get minecraft links I'm blaming you
2012-09-17 23:07:28 Blice said: lol..
2012-09-17 23:07:33 BradPitt|laptop said: http://www.webx.dk/oz2cpu/pcmod/waterblock-gf2-b.jpg
2012-09-17 23:07:47 BradPitt|laptop said: inflow barb -> "maze -> outflow barb
2012-09-17 23:07:54 ferrum said: oh, that's a awesome
2012-09-17 23:08:05 BradPitt|laptop said: you can mill one yourself pretty easily im sure
2012-09-17 23:08:07 ferrum said: yeah, exactly like that
2012-09-17 23:08:27 Blice said: why wouldn't that work for the hands too?
2012-09-17 23:08:29 BradPitt|laptop said: actually idk how easy it is to mill copper
2012-09-17 23:08:30 ferrum said: then cut out the bottom of the ABS tubing and seal the block in very tightly
2012-09-17 23:08:36 ferrum said: Blice: it would
2012-09-17 23:08:44 BradPitt|laptop said: well, its harder to flatten your hand completely
2012-09-17 23:08:46 BradPitt|laptop said: than it is your foot
2012-09-17 23:08:55 BradPitt|laptop said: especially for extended periods of time
2012-09-17 23:09:15 ferrum said: Blice: the tube is probably way more comfortable though
2012-09-17 23:09:30 ferrum said: Blice: when you create the vacuum, it sucks your hand inward because the rubber caves in, and presses your hand very firmly into the bar
2012-09-17 23:09:41 Blice said: hot
2012-09-17 23:09:47 ferrum said: for a foot it shouldn't matter
2012-09-17 23:09:54 Blice said: so ait
2012-09-17 23:09:55 ferrum said: since it would press in a different direction
2012-09-17 23:09:55 Blice said: wait
2012-09-17 23:10:00 Blice said: inside the glove, you hold onto a bar?
2012-09-17 23:10:03 Blice said: and the bar is the cool part?
2012-09-17 23:10:04 ferrum said: yes
2012-09-17 23:10:04 ferrum said: yes
2012-09-17 23:10:09 Blice said: I thought you just flowed water around the glove
2012-09-17 23:10:11 ferrum said: no
2012-09-17 23:10:15 BradPitt|laptop said: yeah same
2012-09-17 23:10:17 BradPitt|laptop said: i feel cheated
2012-09-17 23:10:21 Blice said: same
2012-09-17 23:10:21 _VIPPER_ said: same
2012-09-17 23:10:22 BradPitt|laptop said: fuck your stupid invention
2012-09-17 23:10:25 Blice said: I want my money back ferrum
2012-09-17 23:10:34 BradPitt|laptop said: im cancelling my preorder
2012-09-17 23:10:43 Blice said: is the bar copper?
2012-09-17 23:10:44 ferrum said: BradPitt|laptop: you're the one that linked the instructions on how to build it, did you not even read how it works? >_>
2012-09-17 23:10:47 ferrum said: the bar is brass
2012-09-17 23:10:56 Blice said: hm
2012-09-17 23:11:04 ferrum said: copper would require me to make the screw parts myself
2012-09-17 23:11:06 ferrum said: I did look into copper first
2012-09-17 23:11:41 ferrum said: I don't have the machinery to do that, and I don't know anyone who does
2012-09-17 23:11:51 BradPitt|laptop said: >me
2012-09-17 23:11:53 BradPitt|laptop said: >read things
2012-09-17 23:12:32 ferrum said: doesn't matter, natty steroids ;D
2012-09-17 23:12:47 ferrum said: can't test for gloves
2012-09-17 23:14:48 BradPitt|laptop said: doesn't matter had sex
2012-09-17 23:16:35 Blice said: that's the same logic you use for belts ferrum

2012-09-17 23:21:45 BradPitt|laptop said: well he does that "left, right" look because of dimas
2012-09-17 23:21:51 BradPitt|laptop said: because dimas did it in 2000

2012-09-18 22:51:51 ferrum said: general rule is to eat that, and if you fail, eat more
2012-09-18 22:52:01 rfw said: 2l of milk still sounds like a lot
2012-09-18 22:52:01 ferrum said: as opposed to just eating an ungodly amount from the beginning without reason

2012-09-18 22:56:04 ferrum said: it's just important to realize that as your squat goes up, the amount of calories you'll require goes up
2012-09-18 22:56:12 rfw said: but I really do need to eat more
2012-09-18 22:56:24 ferrum said: to the extent now that if I squat heavy and eat like a normal person, I wind up dropping 2lbs in a week

2012-09-18 22:57:56 ferrum said: don't have to count calories or any of that annoying shit
2012-09-18 22:58:00 rfw said: hopefully I'll be making gains again
2012-09-18 22:58:02 ferrum said: just if lifts fail => eat more, rest more
2012-09-18 22:58:03 rfw said: :D
2012-09-18 22:58:34 ferrum said: you should, I just got my skinny coworker from 120 -> 195 squat
2012-09-18 22:58:44 ferrum said: lbs
2012-09-18 22:58:54 rfw said: !lbs 120
2012-09-18 22:59:04 rfw said: !lb 120
2012-09-18 22:59:04 _VIPPER_ said: 120lbs is 54.4311491323 kg
2012-09-18 22:59:06 ferrum said: like 55
2012-09-18 22:59:42 rfw said: how much is 195
2012-09-18 22:59:56 rfw said: I hate your fucking units by the way
2012-09-18 23:00:09 ferrum said: 195/2.205 ~= 88
2012-09-18 23:00:20 rfw said: ah cool
2012-09-18 23:00:33 rfw said: alright thanks for the advice
2012-09-18 23:00:48 rfw said: hopefully gonna see some gains in a week
2012-09-18 23:01:06 ferrum said: your form is probably wrong
2012-09-18 23:01:18 rfw said: yeah it probably is
2012-09-18 23:01:26 rfw said: I'm working on it
2012-09-18 23:01:59 rfw said: I think my dead lift form is mostly correct
2012-09-18 23:02:17 rfw said: squat form is wonky
2012-09-18 23:02:41 ferrum said: http://images.4chan.org/fit/src/1348017034569.png
2012-09-18 23:02:58 ferrum said: it's pretty hard to mess up deadlift, only thing to watch out for is lower back rounding
2012-09-18 23:03:33 BradPitt said: i just want to be a shredded 85kg lifter with a 300kg total

2012-09-18 23:04:56 rfw said: completely unrelated ferrum you're working on ionmonkey?
2012-09-18 23:04:56 ferrum said: there's this one video where he's just like "kid, powerclean that", and this little guy behind him just casually does it
2012-09-18 23:04:59 ferrum said: rfw: yes

2012-09-18 23:06:10 rfw said: you make me feel bad for using Chrome

2012-09-18 23:06:19 rfw said: :(
2012-09-18 23:06:21 ferrum said: I met with them, I really don't like them
2012-09-18 23:06:25 rfw said: lol
2012-09-18 23:06:35 rfw said: Google code us also horrible
2012-09-18 23:06:47 ferrum said: their leadership is really just gung-ho to take a monopoly position and push native client and dart on everyone
2012-09-18 23:06:55 ferrum said: I didn't think they were, but they are
2012-09-18 23:07:01 rfw said: yeah
2012-09-18 23:07:15 sabar said: I so much brown suger in my coffee it tastes like some weird surup

2012-09-18 23:07:30 ferrum said: 3 hours later, sabar still drinking coffee
2012-09-18 23:07:33 BradPitt|laptop said: :D:D:D
2012-09-18 23:07:39 rfw said: that said I do like the idea of native client
2012-09-18 23:07:44 sabar said: I'm productive
2012-09-18 23:07:44 ferrum said: rfw: no you don't
2012-09-18 23:07:50 rfw said: why not
2012-09-18 23:07:54 ferrum said: rfw: making webpages processor-dependent kills the web
2012-09-18 23:08:00 sabar said: I should get some money today
2012-09-18 23:08:06 rfw said: okay yeah there's that
2012-09-18 23:08:07 ferrum said: they literally ship different code based on processor architecture
2012-09-18 23:08:23 sabar said: :D
2012-09-18 23:08:26 ferrum said: because what else are they going to do?
2012-09-18 23:08:37 ferrum said: JS is fast enough, JS is almost never the bottleneck
2012-09-18 23:08:38 rfw said:  but that said
2012-09-18 23:08:42 ferrum said: they are solving problems that don't exist
2012-09-18 23:08:54 rfw said: I dunno
2012-09-18 23:09:14 ferrum said: mozilla's answer by the way is Emscripten
2012-09-18 23:09:24 rfw said: this is hard to type on a phone
2012-09-18 23:09:25 ferrum said: which lets you still code in C/C++/whatever LLVM targets, and then we compile that to JS
2012-09-18 23:09:44 rfw said: does that get close to native performance
2012-09-18 23:09:57 ferrum said: it's about a magnitude off, but the gap will close
2012-09-18 23:10:13 ferrum said: we can theoretically do even better than a C compiler
2012-09-18 23:10:20 rfw said: because that's the main reason I like the idea of native client
2012-09-18 23:10:45 ferrum said: the plan is to beat GCC performance with JS, yes.
2012-09-18 23:10:53 rfw said: lol
2012-09-18 23:10:56 BradPitt|laptop said: ugh next step for this app is frontend design
2012-09-18 23:11:01 BradPitt|laptop said: rfw halp
2012-09-18 23:11:13 rfw said: BradPitt|laptop: lol
2012-09-18 23:11:21 BradPitt|laptop said: ill probably just use bootstrap tbh
2012-09-18 23:11:27 BradPitt|laptop said: make it as painless as possible
2012-09-18 23:11:59 rfw said: ferrum: is js1.7 standardized in ecmascript yet
2012-09-18 23:12:46 ferrum said: no idea
2012-09-18 23:12:53 rfw said: :(
2012-09-18 23:13:00 ferrum said: we don't JIT any of these new things anyway
2012-09-18 23:13:08 rfw said: oh
2012-09-18 23:13:30 ferrum said: iterators yes, generators no, let no
2012-09-18 23:14:10 ferrum said: it appears that the answer is no, ES6 hasn't come out yet
2012-09-18 23:15:12 rfw said: ES6 is a bunch of confused committee members proposing whatever falls out of their ass
2012-09-18 23:15:43 ferrum said: I'm mostly excited about optimizing emscripten-generated code
2012-09-18 23:15:50 rfw said: yeah
2012-09-18 23:15:56 ferrum said: which explicitly does not use any new features, and doesn't use objects
2012-09-18 23:16:02 ferrum said: looks nothing like existing JS code
2012-09-18 23:16:14 ferrum said: everything is stored in a huge uint8 typed array
2012-09-18 23:17:05 rfw said: it seems low level enough to jit relatively easily too
2012-09-18 23:17:29 ferrum said: well, importantly it contains tons of jit hints
2012-09-18 23:17:46 ferrum said: for example, (a+b) as int32 in JS requires an overflow check
2012-09-18 23:17:58 ferrum said: (a+b)|0 in JS omits the overflow check and is way faster
2012-09-18 23:18:05 rfw said: ah, neat
2012-09-18 23:18:10 ferrum said: v8 knows to do that also
2012-09-18 23:18:18 rfw said: I did not know that
2012-09-18 23:18:41 ferrum said: or (a+b)&-1 or (a+b)&0xFFFFFFFF
2012-09-18 23:18:57 ferrum said: although v8 only supports 31-bit integers so they get different performance
2012-09-18 23:30:37 rfw said: ferrum: it would seem to be viable to implement parts of the emscripten runtime in the js engine
2012-09-18 23:31:00 rfw said: but i somehow think that people don't want to do that
2012-09-18 23:31:21 ferrum said: this kills the web
2012-09-18 23:31:29 rfw said: but why
2012-09-18 23:31:30 rfw said: :(
2012-09-18 23:31:41 ferrum said: we'd need to convince apple, google, microsoft, and opera to do the same thing, we'd want it standardized, etc
2012-09-18 23:31:53 ferrum said: you should not have special performance in firefox
2012-09-18 23:31:59 ferrum said: we have no interest in cheating
2012-09-18 23:32:06 rfw said: i realize that
2012-09-18 23:32:14 rfw said: and i guess one of the downfalls of the web is it being so fragmented
2012-09-18 23:32:20 ferrum said: it's not fragmented
2012-09-18 23:32:27 ferrum said: google is trying their hardest though
2012-09-18 23:32:34 rfw said: i dunno, IE10 is still derp.jpg
2012-09-18 23:32:45 BradPitt said: god this fucking lol game
2012-09-18 23:32:47 BradPitt said: has me all flustered
2012-09-18 23:32:59 ferrum said: the major current problem is that webdevs for mobile seem to think that "webkit" == "web"
2012-09-18 23:33:10 ferrum said: and so mobile firefox is fucked, because all the mobile sites use webkit-only extensions
2012-09-18 23:33:40 ferrum said: when I talked with the chrome guys, they actually said that it would be great if 100% of the web were webkit
2012-09-18 23:33:46 ferrum said: I hate them so much.
2012-09-18 23:33:48 rfw said: as a web developer, i'm inclined to agree
2012-09-18 23:34:02 rfw said: because i don't want to write a site using browser X then have to make it work with browser Y and browser Z
2012-09-18 23:34:08 BradPitt said: no one does
2012-09-18 23:34:15 BradPitt said: but web technology is so fragmented and fucked
2012-09-18 23:34:21 ferrum said: that's a consequence of the web being a specification, not an implementation
2012-09-18 23:34:30 ferrum said: if you say "the web is whatever webkit is", you kill all competition for all time
2012-09-18 23:34:44 ferrum said: the whole point of the web is that it's the one, the fucking ONE platform we have that is vendor-neutral
2012-09-18 23:34:49 ferrum said: do not fucking tie it to a single vendor
2012-09-18 23:34:52 ferrum said: god fucking damnit I'm mad.
2012-09-18 23:35:00 rfw said: i understand your point of view
2012-09-18 23:35:26 rfw said: but the majority of developers are lazy and angry about having to support X and Y and Z without it just working
2012-09-18 23:35:45 ferrum said: everything should work everywhere, unless they start typing "-webkit" or "-moz"
2012-09-18 23:35:55 ferrum said: and they do, so it doesn't work everywhere
2012-09-18 23:36:25 ferrum said: discounting IE not supporting things like WebGL because they're stupid
2012-09-18 23:36:50 rfw said: you say that, but as a developer i can't use JS1.7 in chrome or certain -webkit- extensions in firefox
2012-09-18 23:36:56 rfw said: and that just makes me tired of being a web developer
2012-09-18 23:37:23 ferrum said: well, yes, if you use features that aren't standardized they won't work the same everywhere
2012-09-18 23:37:44 ferrum said: I don't think that's a real problem to be solved
2012-09-18 23:37:53 ferrum said: there's no real alternative
2012-09-18 23:37:59 rfw said: sadly :(
2012-09-18 23:39:01 BradPitt said: everything should be straight HTML
2012-09-18 23:39:12 rfw said: BradPitt wants to move back to the 1990s
2012-09-18 23:39:13 ferrum said: would make my life easier
2012-09-18 23:39:20 ferrum said: could go off and work on Rust :)
2012-09-18 23:39:42 rfw said: ferrum: we can agree to disagree :>
2012-09-18 23:48:52 ferrum said: one more glass away from a gallon

2012-09-19 00:11:18 ferrum said: way harder
2012-09-19 00:11:19 BradPitt said: expect to take about 20-30kg off

2012-09-19 01:38:17 BradPitt said: send dick pix for insta-hire
2012-09-19 01:38:17 rfw said: also probably a pretty awkward thing to do
2012-09-19 01:38:20 ferrum said: yeah
2012-09-19 01:38:21 rfw said: "hi guys, interview me pls"
2012-09-19 01:39:01 ferrum said: well he didn't ask for an interview, just to go to lunch
2012-09-19 01:39:06 ferrum said: and they liked him so much from the lunch that we hired him
2012-09-19 01:39:28 ferrum said: he's not particularly personable, just talks directly and has good ideas

2012-09-19 02:10:05 wonderbeaver said: hmm
2012-09-19 02:10:09 wonderbeaver said: no ferrum i was just going to ask
2012-09-19 02:10:34 wonderbeaver said: if it really is so impossible to work for places like google etc with out going to well known unis
2012-09-19 02:11:05 ferrum said: with mozilla yes, with google maybe, but they tend to have so many good people flooding in from the top unis that they don't bother recruiting elsewhere
2012-09-19 02:11:25 ferrum said: mozilla doesn't recruit elsewhere either, but we tend to interview more broadly based on different criteria (community involvement and shit)
2012-09-19 02:11:52 wonderbeaver said: i mean the uni i go to is well known
2012-09-19 02:11:57 ferrum said: so it's not impossible, but there are more barriers if you're not from a top university
2012-09-19 02:12:26 wonderbeaver said: yea ferrum
2012-09-19 02:12:27 wonderbeaver said: i mean
2012-09-19 02:12:32 wonderbeaver said: that means ivy league ?
2012-09-19 02:12:33 ferrum said: for example I didn't really have to have personal projects and stuff, my resume was mostly "I taught operating systems at CMU", and everyone was throwing jobs at me
2012-09-19 02:12:40 ferrum said: no, ivy league is for politicians and lawyers
2012-09-19 02:12:51 ferrum said: means CMU/MIT/Stanford
2012-09-19 02:13:24 wonderbeaver said: what about like upenn, umich, nyu
2012-09-19 02:13:29 ferrum said: zero
2012-09-19 02:13:36 ferrum said: umich mozilla had one guy
2012-09-19 02:13:57 ferrum said: nyu none, upenn none

2012-09-19 02:15:32 ferrum said: so is CMU
2012-09-19 02:15:38 wonderbeaver said: seriously
2012-09-19 02:15:49 ferrum said: yes, my classes were almost entirely male
2012-09-19 02:15:53 wonderbeaver said: MIT
2012-09-19 02:15:55 ferrum said: upper-level CS was entirely male
2012-09-19 02:15:56 wonderbeaver said: Stanford too
2012-09-19 02:16:05 wonderbeaver said: why dont women ever do science
2012-09-19 02:16:05 ferrum said: I think less in those schools because they enforce gender ratios more heavily
2012-09-19 02:16:11 wonderbeaver said: that doesnt involve hospitals
2012-09-19 02:16:22 ferrum said: a bunch do, many of my friends are girl programmers
2012-09-19 02:16:29 ferrum said: they're just not... good
2012-09-19 02:16:34 wonderbeaver said: lol
2012-09-19 02:16:43 ferrum said: but one of them works for google, another for microsoft
2012-09-19 02:16:43 wonderbeaver said: you know what i dont get
2012-09-19 02:16:50 wonderbeaver said: there are more women than men in uni
2012-09-19 02:16:55 wonderbeaver said: so where do all the women go
2012-09-19 02:17:00 wonderbeaver said: or are top unis just mostly male
2012-09-19 02:17:01 rfw said: liberal arts
2012-09-19 02:17:03 ferrum said: meet men, stay-at-home moms
2012-09-19 02:17:10 ferrum said: go to uni to find a husband
2012-09-19 02:17:42 ferrum said: girl programmers aren't good because they treat programming like a job
2012-09-19 02:18:15 ferrum said: there's no art in it, they don't really bother to understand it deeply, they have easy access to lush social lives and they'd rather spend their time enjoying themselves socially
2012-09-19 02:18:26 ferrum said: which is fine, but it makes them middle-tier programmers
2012-09-19 02:18:42 beaver said: dont get how women are always knee deep in friends
2012-09-19 02:18:42 ferrum said: obviously exceptions, but this is true of all the girl programmers I know save one
2012-09-19 02:18:48 ferrum said: beaver: /male/ friends
2012-09-19 02:18:49 beaver said: if they are half way attractive
2012-09-19 02:18:59 ferrum said: girls I know have zero female friends
2012-09-19 02:19:07 beaver said: well
2012-09-19 02:19:09 ferrum said: they just surround themselves with beta, nerdy guys
2012-09-19 02:19:14 beaver said: to be fair ferrum

2012-09-19 11:35:27 _vex_ said: BradPitt: [19:48] <_vex_> Hi, today I went for 3x5 OHP and got 4-4-0 reps, all sets reached failure. My last set has never been this low compared to the other two.. Any specific reason, did I overtrain my upper body, or what the hell is going on? I was hungry while training, but still..
2012-09-19 11:35:32 _vex_ said: what's your view on it? :)
2012-09-19 11:35:44 x4nti said: i have a question
2012-09-19 11:35:51 x4nti said: do you bounce your ohp?
2012-09-19 11:35:57 BradPitt said: was OHP your first lift of the day?
2012-09-19 11:35:58 x4nti said: or do you pause at the bootom?
2012-09-19 11:36:08 x4nti said: bottom*
2012-09-19 11:36:46 cunnelatio said: not really "bouncing"
2012-09-19 11:36:52 cunnelatio said: but you don't wanna dead stop after ever rep
2012-09-19 11:37:02 cunnelatio said: that will make it a lot harder for no reason
2012-09-19 11:37:27 x4nti said: for no reason other than that you do each lift like an isolated lift?
2012-09-19 11:37:35 x4nti said: that's a good thing
2012-09-19 11:37:52 _vex_ said: BradPitt: Yes. x4nti I keep legs straight but move hips a very small bit
2012-09-19 11:38:00 _vex_ said: oh, and I don't bounce
2012-09-19 11:38:06 BradPitt said: could just be rest, food, sleep
2012-09-19 11:38:07 x4nti said: this has nothing to do with legs
2012-09-19 11:38:14 _vex_ said: misunderstood at first
2012-09-19 11:38:15 BradPitt said: if its just 1 workout, don't worry about it
2012-09-19 11:38:21 BradPitt said: maybe take longer rest in between sets
2012-09-19 11:38:44 BradPitt said: if it continues to happen, then you should probably change something with diet and/or routine (like alternating strict ohp with heavy push press)
2012-09-19 11:39:58 _vex_ said: it was only one workout, yes, it just never happened before that I got zero reps
2012-09-19 11:40:02 _vex_ said: I did take about 7 minute breaks
2012-09-19 11:40:26 BradPitt said: might be due to sleep or nutrition from day of or day prior
2012-09-19 11:40:49 _vex_ said: got around 7 hours both days prior
2012-09-19 11:40:54 _vex_ said: it's average for me
2012-09-19 11:41:00 cunnelatio said: are you gaining weight
2012-09-19 11:41:07 _vex_ said: yes cunnelatio
2012-09-19 11:41:49 cunnelatio said: thats the most important thing
2012-09-19 11:41:59 cunnelatio said: if you arent eating enough bench and ohp are the first things to go
2012-09-19 11:43:53 _vex_ said: well BradPitt thanks for the advice, I will stop worrying and see how it goes next time
2012-09-19 11:44:16 BradPitt said: yeah I normally don't worry about things going bad for 1 day - just chalk it up to an off day. But if it continues then something needs to chane
2012-09-19 11:44:19 BradPitt said: change
2012-09-19 11:44:54 ferrum said: _vex_: consider bouncing, by the way. I've found that my ability get reps with OHP is inversely proportional to the time I spend holding the bar
2012-09-19 11:45:17 ferrum said: it's not like using the stretch reflex makes you weaker
2012-09-19 11:45:20 _vex_ said: ferrum: Isn't it sorta cheating?
2012-09-19 11:45:22 ferrum said: if it did, we'd be doing squats from the bottom
2012-09-19 11:46:23 _vex_ said: I guess..
2012-09-19 11:46:23 ferrum said: _vex_: no, your muscles are still doing all the work
2012-09-19 11:46:23 Blice said: _vex_: SS doesn't say to pause at the bottom
2012-09-19 11:46:27 ferrum said: cheating means using unrelated stuff to get the bar up, like humping it on bench or using your back on curls
2012-09-19 11:46:46 ferrum said: or legs on press
2012-09-19 11:46:51 BradPitt said: Rizon pls
2012-09-19 11:47:21 Troller said: man i hope all those fly corpses serve as a deterrant to other flies
2012-09-19 11:47:35 _vex_ said: will keep that in mind then, and try bouncing a bit
2012-09-19 11:47:36 ferrum said: the hip motion is cheating, but that's OK because it removes the worst sticking point and lets you actually do the exercise.
2012-09-19 11:47:40 _vex_ said: upper part of the lift is the easiest part so yeah
2012-09-19 11:48:10 cunnelatio said: it feels hardest right at the crown of my head
2012-09-19 11:48:23 ferrum said: yeah, that's where you switch from triceps to upper back
2012-09-19 11:48:28 ferrum said: that's the hardest part for me
2012-09-19 11:48:45 x4nti said: "hip motion is cheating"
2012-09-19 11:48:46 BradPitt said: be sure you are jamming your head under the bar
2012-09-19 11:48:51 BradPitt said: that will help activate your traps
2012-09-19 11:49:03 x4nti said: the point of ohp is just to lift thing overhead without using your legs
2012-09-19 11:49:07 x4nti said: hips are okay
2012-09-19 11:49:18 ferrum said: x4nti: it serves the same purpose as a push press
2012-09-19 11:49:28 ferrum said: it's just less effective, so you can't cheat as badly
2012-09-19 11:49:44 x4nti said: push press is push press
2012-09-19 11:49:53 x4nti said: it's not cheating, it's another exercise
2012-09-19 11:49:58 ferrum said: you're missing the logic here
2012-09-19 11:50:05 x4nti said: the definition of ohp allows for hip motion
2012-09-19 11:50:24 x4nti said: it's like saying that good morning squats are cheating
2012-09-19 11:50:34 _vex_ said: also I feel my OHP is quite high compared to bench, bench is 60 kgs 3x5, ohp is 46 3x5.. Is it no reason to worry?
2012-09-19 11:51:06 _vex_ said: or I guess my bench is low compared to the ohp
2012-09-19 11:51:35 BradPitt said: yeah
2012-09-19 11:51:37 BradPitt said: the problem is
2012-09-19 11:51:40 BradPitt said: your bench blows donkey dick
2012-09-19 11:51:44 BradPitt said: try to solve that problem
2012-09-19 11:51:52 _vex_ said: yup, no denying it
2012-09-19 11:51:57 x4nti said: that's around 75%
2012-09-19 11:52:06 x4nti said: it's quite ordinary
2012-09-19 11:52:28 _vex_ said: bench is just always getting stuck.. Ugh
2012-09-19 11:52:31 BradPitt said: guys my dog is on creatine monohydrate
2012-09-19 11:52:31 BradPitt said: srs
2012-09-19 11:52:35 BradPitt said: he took 250mg this morning
2012-09-19 11:52:38 BradPitt said: for joint health
2012-09-19 11:52:43 BradPitt said: will he get gains?
2012-09-19 11:52:46 _vex_ said: join health?
2012-09-19 11:52:47 BradPitt said: im scared he might roid rage
2012-09-19 11:52:48 x4nti said: 250mg is nothing
2012-09-19 11:52:56 _vex_ said: interesting
2012-09-19 11:52:58 BradPitt said: x4nti man don't sugar coat it just give it to me straigtht
2012-09-19 11:53:02 BradPitt said: is he going to go insane?
2012-09-19 11:53:06 BradPitt said: ive locked myself in my room
2012-09-19 11:53:10 BradPitt said: should I barricade the door?
2012-09-19 11:53:30 Blice said: BradPitt to compensate take his collar off if its leather
2012-09-19 11:53:33 Blice said: belt rage is the worst
2012-09-19 11:53:50 BradPitt said: blice im not a noob he has a nylon collar
2012-09-19 11:53:55 BradPitt said: i would never put myself in that much danger
2012-09-19 11:54:18 BradPitt said: well, we did give him a leather collar when he was a puppy (wanted to take advantage of noob gains)
2012-09-19 11:54:25 _vex_ said: also, at bench, I think I strained a lower back muscle from arching too much (or possibly from going too low at squats with zero flexibility) so arching "properly" with tightness hurts, so I arch less.. Am I messing up my technique or should I stop worrying?
2012-09-19 11:54:32 BradPitt said: but after he completed Started Barking we switched to nylon
2012-09-19 11:54:44 _vex_ said: and just do semi-flat bench until it stops hurting?
2012-09-19 11:57:55 BradPitt said: stretch your back
2012-09-19 11:58:09 frogprince said: =)
2012-09-19 11:58:16 _vex_ said: *stretch*?
2012-09-19 11:58:20 BradPitt said: yes
2012-09-19 11:58:26 BradPitt said: just google "back stretches"
2012-09-19 11:58:34 BradPitt said: usually its a lot of yoga/pilates stuff
2012-09-19 11:58:44 _vex_ said: probably a good idea
2012-09-19 11:58:50 BradPitt said: sometimes my back gets tight on arched bench if i arch too much, but it goes away after a day or two
2012-09-19 11:59:01 _vex_ said: well, mine's been here for a few weeks now
2012-09-19 11:59:07 _vex_ said: stopped squats and dls to let it heal
2012-09-19 11:59:18 BradPitt said: sounds like you need to stretch and do light Good Mornings to strengthen it
2012-09-19 11:59:20 _vex_ said: don't want to worsen it and have to take a long break
2012-09-19 11:59:21 BradPitt said: also, don't neglect abs
2012-09-19 12:01:08 Troller said: what ab exercise is good
2012-09-19 12:01:14 Troller said: i have to do some werid crunches for the army
2012-09-19 12:01:20 Troller said: but maybe they hurt my back
2012-09-19 12:01:21 Troller said: :/
2012-09-19 12:01:22 _vex_ said: I wonder too, it seems like there's no standard best exercise for abs
2012-09-19 12:01:25 _vex_ said: at least no agreed-on
2012-09-19 12:01:37 _vex_ said: like squats are for legs and so on, for example
2012-09-19 12:01:40 BradPitt said: hanging leg raises to full V, those standing rope crunches and rollouts
2012-09-19 12:03:24 Troller said: http://alosertao.com.br/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/mosca.jpg killed 7 of those motherfuckers

2012-09-19 12:03:43 Troller said: my arm is wswole
2012-09-19 12:03:53 BradPitt said: killing a fly is basically just like killing the enemy
2012-09-19 12:05:21 BradPitt said: if your abs aren't strong enough for rollouts, do the standing cable crunch
2012-09-19 12:05:34 Troller said: for me those flies are worse than the enemy, they are in my kitchen corrupting my food
2012-09-19 12:06:02 Troller said: the enemy will probably be some guys that few guys in my country and some jews decide its the enemy
2012-09-19 12:06:27 BradPitt said: yeah man just keep killing flies for practice man you will be a good warrior :DDD
2012-09-19 12:06:33 Troller said: hahah
2012-09-19 12:07:00 Troller said: you might think its nothing but its better than to stay at the pc, flies are hard to spot, they are fast and they can hide from your eyesight easily
2012-09-19 12:07:08 BradPitt said: true
2012-09-19 12:07:09 Troller said: can get frustrating
2012-09-19 12:07:32 BradPitt said: once you get good with the flyswatter you can try to catch them with chopsticks for a better workout
2012-09-19 12:07:41 Troller said: i dont even have a fly swatter

2012-09-19 14:56:14 ferrum said: remove the search bar in the upper-right corner
2012-09-19 14:56:30 ferrum said: searching gives you a special sidebar that lets you quickly re-execute the same search in a different engine

2012-09-19 14:56:55 ferrum said: so for example, you'd search for "Nazis", then you can easily also search for "Nazis" on Yahoo, Twitter, Wikipedia, etc
2012-09-19 14:57:02 ferrum said: by just clicking a single button
2012-09-19 14:57:22 ferrum said: the goal would be to let you more easily explore results with other engines

2012-09-19 14:58:53 ferrum said: we'd have to hardcode google's layout
2012-09-19 14:58:57 ferrum said: only google can do that

2012-09-21 22:42:24 ferrum said: Blice: the good news is that means I'll take a deload week, so you can see me squat whatever >= 405
2012-09-21 22:42:30 Onijin said: lol
2012-09-21 22:42:49 ferrum said: strength wasn't there on the 5th rep anyway
2012-09-21 22:43:17 Onijin said: why do you need to ask a guy on a SS forum what to do
2012-09-21 22:43:33 Onijin said: Just do more squats
2012-09-21 22:43:44 Onijin said: and hypertrophy the muscles involved in squatting
2012-09-21 22:43:46 ferrum said: you're a dumbass
2012-09-21 22:43:49 Onijin said: and your squat magically goes up
2012-09-21 22:43:51 Onijin said: it's that simple
2012-09-21 22:43:55 Onijin said: it really is
2012-09-21 22:44:01 ferrum said: I squat like 3x more than you
2012-09-21 22:44:26 Onijin said: that's irrelevant
2012-09-21 22:44:43 Onijin said: you just need to squat more
2012-09-21 22:44:56 Onijin said: and build your hammies/erectors
2012-09-21 22:45:15 Onijin said: the guy on the SS forum will just tell you to do the same
2012-09-21 22:45:30 Onijin said: he will be like "more volume" or "more intensity" or "more frequency"
2012-09-21 22:45:43 Onijin said: I bet you anything it just involves more squatting
2012-09-21 22:45:59 ferrum said: how much do you bet
2012-09-21 22:46:30 ferrum said: so if he says go to a 3RM and drop down volume day, I get $100?
2012-09-21 22:46:44 ferrum said: and if he says "you just need to squat more and build your hammies/erectors", you get $100
2012-09-21 22:46:46 Onijin said: no because you increased your intensity
2012-09-21 22:46:50 Onijin said: which is squatting more
2012-09-21 22:47:12 ferrum said: you are completely unqualified to talk about this topic
2012-09-21 22:47:43 Onijin said: well lets see what he says then
2012-09-21 22:47:51 ferrum said: that's the plan
2012-09-21 22:49:29 Onijin said: I still don't understand why you need this guy to help you
2012-09-21 22:51:01 ferrum said: I have been stalled at around 445 for about three months
2012-09-21 22:51:09 ferrum said: tried a number of things to remedy it, but they all failed
2012-09-21 22:51:24 ferrum said: so I'm going to ask the guy who advises people on TM for a living
2012-09-21 22:51:25 Onijin said: Have you tried increasing volume?
2012-09-21 22:51:48 ferrum said: yes, that had an even more negative effect
2012-09-21 22:51:52 Onijin said: Have you tried increasing intensity?
2012-09-21 22:51:54 ferrum said: decreasing volume had a positive effect
2012-09-21 22:52:13 ferrum said: I think your usage of volume/intensity is going to be different from mine
2012-09-21 22:52:14 Onijin said: Have you tried increasing frequency?
2012-09-21 22:52:22 ferrum said: Onijin pls go
2012-09-21 22:52:41 Onijin said: ferrum, if you have only changed your volume
2012-09-21 22:52:49 oatzhakok said: ferrum: how long till your comp?
2012-09-21 22:52:51 Onijin said: you still have two whole factors you've not even tried yet
2012-09-21 22:52:55 ferrum said: oatzhakok: not going to comp
2012-09-21 22:52:58 oatzhakok said: ;-;

2012-09-21 22:53:00 cunnelatio said: have you tried trenbolone acetate?
2012-09-21 22:53:21 ferrum said: oatzhakok: combination of not knowing whether I'll pass drug tests and that I keep failing squats
2012-09-21 22:53:31 oatzhakok said: what drugs you take?
2012-09-21 22:53:33 oatzhakok said: also since you're not competing, why not gain 10lbs or so?
2012-09-21 22:53:46 ferrum said: oatzhakok: medications, doctor can't tell me whether they'll show up as anything or not
2012-09-21 22:53:51 ferrum said: oatzhakok: that's what I'm doing actually :)

2012-09-21 22:54:12 oatzhakok said: is the eating helping?
2012-09-21 22:54:15 Onijin said: drug testing is stupid and immoral

2012-09-21 22:55:31 Onijin said: 64.4kg isn't a class ferrum
2012-09-21 22:55:40 ferrum said: yes I know, but that's one of the lowest
2012-09-21 22:55:46 oatzhakok said: Onijin: are you the black kid?

2012-09-21 22:59:00 Onijin said: I need to get my squat up to 180kg and my bench up to 100kg at 75kg to do well in competition
2012-09-21 22:59:21 cunnelatio said: 100kg seems a bit light for 165
2012-09-21 22:59:37 Onijin said: I am built to deadlift so it will always be shitty
2012-09-21 22:59:43 cunnelatio said: like, theres this guy at my gym who is about 165, 5'10" and he puts up 315 or so

2012-09-21 23:01:39 Onijin said: it's a 3 lift sport
2012-09-21 23:02:43 cunnelatio said: cut off your legs and compete in disabled powerlifting

2012-09-21 23:03:52 Onijin said: I find none of the main lifts really carry over to each other
2012-09-21 23:04:29 Onijin said: I got my squat up 40kg in the last 6 months but all my deadlift increased by was maybe 15-20kg and I was doing lots of deadlifts
2012-09-21 23:04:38 cunnelatio said: conversely
2012-09-21 23:04:43 cunnelatio said: I lost 30 lbs

2012-09-21 23:05:03 cunnelatio said: fuck it
2012-09-21 23:05:12 Onijin said: to increase the deadlift
2012-09-21 23:05:29 cunnelatio said: yeah but I care less about how much I dl since suffering a low back injury
2012-09-21 23:05:29 Onijin said: if you don't want a big deadlift then why are you even doing them
2012-09-21 23:05:58 cunnelatio said: second set 410x3 fucked something on the last rep, didnt feel bad and went on to 455
2012-09-21 23:06:00 cunnelatio said: snap
2012-09-21 23:06:07 cunnelatio said: didnt walk right for two months

2012-09-22 00:52:11 ferrum said: 22:39 <&ferrum> Blice: got 165 2x3 on press :)
2012-09-22 00:52:14 ferrum said: 22:40 <&ferrum> I'll ask KSC on the SS forums what he recommends I do
2012-09-22 00:52:16 ferrum said: 22:40 <&ferrum> probably that'll be switch to 3RMs

2012-09-22 00:57:05 Onijin said: it's not just an illusion
2012-09-22 00:57:07 ferrum said: cunnelatio: clearly you don't read the SS forums
2012-09-22 00:57:10 Onijin said: it's a new state of being

2012-09-22 00:57:32 Onijin said: in second reality - you make the decisions
2012-09-22 00:57:49 cunnelatio said: how much do you weigh ferrum
2012-09-22 00:57:55 ferrum said: 173.4
2012-09-22 00:57:59 cunnelatio said: damn b
2012-09-22 00:58:02 cunnelatio said: good squat
2012-09-22 00:58:10 ferrum said: I want 600
2012-09-22 00:58:10 cunnelatio said: you might have to gain some weight to squat more
2012-09-22 00:58:33 cunnelatio said: what I like doing is gaining 10 lbs, then cutting 10
2012-09-22 00:58:40 cunnelatio said: repeat until desired musculature
2012-09-22 00:58:43 ferrum said: oh, I like gaining 10 and then keeping it forever like a trophy
2012-09-22 00:58:54 ferrum said: implying my legs are not already way beyond the desired musculature
2012-09-22 00:59:00 ferrum said: impling my ass isn't larger than my head
2012-09-22 00:59:00 cunnelatio said: well if you go back and forth you'll have more muscle and less fat every time
2012-09-22 00:59:02 ferrum said: implying implying
2012-09-22 00:59:04 cunnelatio said: without getting huge and fat
2012-09-22 00:59:19 ferrum said: I would prefer to be fat so my ass/leg muscle is hidden
2012-09-22 00:59:28 cunnelatio said: that will just make them look bigger
2012-09-22 00:59:32 ferrum said: fuck
2012-09-22 00:59:49 ferrum said: when you get huge glutes btw, it's very obvious that our posture was not meant to be standing
2012-09-22 00:59:58 ferrum said: standing up puts glutes in a position of maximum flexion
2012-09-22 01:00:14 ferrum said: it is very uncomfortable
2012-09-22 01:00:16 cunnelatio said: really we're not meant to stand
2012-09-22 01:00:23 cunnelatio said: perhaps we're not meant to squat 445x4
2012-09-22 01:00:25 Onijin said: I keep hitting my ass on things recently
2012-09-22 01:00:34 Onijin said: I genetically have a big ass anyway
2012-09-22 01:00:35 ferrum said: of course we're meant to squat 445
2012-09-22 01:00:46 cunnelatio said: squatting is hella unnatural
2012-09-22 01:00:53 cunnelatio said: at least with a load on your shoulders
2012-09-22 01:01:03 ferrum said: the whole point of squatting is that it's a natural movement
2012-09-22 01:01:08 ferrum said: that's why your body can coordinate it so well
2012-09-22 01:01:15 cunnelatio said: yeah squatting your bodyweight doesn't load your spine
2012-09-22 01:01:21 ferrum said: SPINE IS FINE
2012-09-22 01:01:39 Onijin said: I will post a pic of my ass from a few months ago
2012-09-22 01:01:40 Onijin said: lel
2012-09-22 01:01:49 ferrum said: no thank you
2012-09-22 01:01:52 cunnelatio said: i heard trap bar deadlifts are safer and hit the same shit :o
2012-09-22 01:02:07 Onijin said: so is stamp collecting
2012-09-22 01:02:12 ferrum said: cunnelatio: no, fuck fuck fuck fuck
2012-09-22 01:02:19 ferrum said: cunnelatio: spinal compression cannot damage the spine
2012-09-22 01:02:23 ferrum said: cunnelatio: it's shear forces that damage it
2012-09-22 01:02:30 ferrum said: like when you decide to do weighted situps
2012-09-22 01:02:51 ferrum said: or when you fuck up a rep and curve your lower back and now all that force that would have been in-line with your spine is now forcing apart vertebrae
2012-09-22 01:03:09 cunnelatio said: well im sure the squishy bits have a limit to how much compression they can take
2012-09-22 01:03:21 ferrum said: your squat will always be lower than that limit
2012-09-22 01:03:29 ferrum said: that is not an injury that has ever happened
2012-09-22 01:03:29 cunnelatio said: well mine will be
2012-09-22 01:03:30 Onijin said: weighted sit-ups are not that bad tbh
2012-09-22 01:03:35 cunnelatio said: because I am not a t-rex

2012-09-22 01:05:08 cunnelatio said: I will still squat because I hate leg press more
2012-09-22 01:05:13 cunnelatio said: dragging fuckin 10+ plates around the gym
2012-09-22 01:05:16 cunnelatio said: then putting them back
2012-09-22 01:05:25 ferrum said: Onijin: But you're a sucker. You're being fed this line about how, like, you're gonna live forever or whatever; you're gonna die
2012-09-22 01:05:26 cunnelatio said: it increases my blood pressure a ton too, I literally see stars
2012-09-22 01:05:36 ferrum said: Onijin: you're gonna die real soon. Someone'll come up and stab you with a knife.
2012-09-22 01:05:42 Onijin said: lel
2012-09-22 01:06:03 ferrum said: Onijin: Hey, you look good, man! You got good guns! You wanna make sure your abs are freakin' ripped for when you get stabbed with a knife.
2012-09-22 01:06:07 ferrum said: Onijin: sorry but that's how it works
2012-09-22 01:06:18 Onijin said: lots of strong people do exercises that involve heavy spinal flexion
2012-09-22 01:06:36 cunnelatio said: isometrics work great for abs I find
2012-09-22 01:06:43 ferrum said: I have awesome abs just from squatting

2012-09-22 01:07:40 cunnelatio said: just a different way of doing it
2012-09-22 01:08:00 cunnelatio said: no flexion but still gives you juicy abs
2012-09-22 01:08:09 cunnelatio said: l-sit pullups are good too
2012-09-22 01:08:28 Onijin said: there is flexion involved

2012-09-22 01:11:25 cunnelatio said: do either of you do any hamstring specific stuff
2012-09-22 01:11:40 cunnelatio said: I dont feel like squats are enough for them tbh
2012-09-22 01:12:24 Onijin said: Yeah I do hamstring work every session
2012-09-22 01:12:36 Onijin said: as my stance is fairly wide
2012-09-22 01:12:43 cunnelatio said: ghr?
2012-09-22 01:13:03 ferrum said: cunnelatio: hamstrings only function isometrically during squat, they will not get big
2012-09-22 01:13:05 Onijin said: no, it will get in the way of your squatting and most ghr are shit
2012-09-22 01:13:21 ferrum said: cunnelatio: you do not need big hamstrings, if you want them do isolation
2012-09-22 01:13:32 cunnelatio said: i just do it on those decline benches that are meant for like situps
2012-09-22 01:13:41 cunnelatio said: no ghr specific machine
2012-09-22 01:13:47 Onijin said: Hamstring curls are good enough
2012-09-22 01:13:55 Onijin said: just do a few easy sets of 20
2012-09-22 01:13:59 Onijin said: for maximum pump
2012-09-22 01:14:05 cunnelatio said: leg biceps
2012-09-22 01:14:19 cunnelatio said: im sure strong hamstrings are good for...something
2012-09-22 01:14:45 ferrum said: maybe some wrestling moves
2012-09-22 01:14:56 ferrum said: LEG CURL HIS FACE JIM
2012-09-22 01:15:15 Onijin said: The hamstrings are involved in the squat anyway
2012-09-22 01:15:27 Onijin said: they just lengthen at one end and shorten at the other
2012-09-22 01:15:38 cunnelatio said: it seems like hamstrings would be involved in the squat the same way biceps would be involved in a bench press
2012-09-22 01:15:44 cunnelatio said: ie pretty much not at all
2012-09-22 01:15:45 ferrum said: yeah pretty much
2012-09-22 01:15:52 ferrum said: source: I squat 445 and my hamstrings are tiny
2012-09-22 01:15:57 Onijin said: hamstrings are hip extensors as well as knee flexors
2012-09-22 01:16:10 cunnelatio said: isnt being too quad dominant an injury waiting to happen
2012-09-22 01:16:11 ferrum said: I can leg curl like 110 max >_>
2012-09-22 01:16:36 Onijin said: If you significantly hypertrophy your hamstrings then your squat will go up
2012-09-22 01:16:42 Onijin said: they are very important in the squat
2012-09-22 01:16:44 ferrum said: thanks dr. shit science

2012-09-22 01:18:04 ferrum said: I had a swim coach who did that to us
2012-09-22 01:18:10 cunnelatio said: people tell me I make retarded faces when I do them
2012-09-22 01:18:15 Onijin said: yeah ferrum

2012-09-22 01:20:12 cunnelatio said: gotta push
2012-09-22 01:20:29 Onijin said: Jim Wendler also says that the hamstrings are hella important in the squat
2012-09-22 01:20:53 Onijin said: cunnelatio, if you can't do full reps then why don't you do something that you can in the meantime
2012-09-22 01:21:02 cunnelatio said: I do negatives
2012-09-22 01:21:10 cunnelatio said: and give myself a push to start out at the bottom
2012-09-22 01:22:06 cunnelatio said: I don't even know why I care, I only squat for the sake of balance
2012-09-22 01:22:11 cunnelatio said: should prob just add more curls
2012-09-22 01:22:52 cunnelatio said: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KVq4W6s_UQ

2012-09-22 11:42:15 Raggles said: perfect
2012-09-22 11:42:49 Raggles said: I'm attempting to use irssi
2012-09-22 11:42:54 Raggles said: I do not see the appeal
2012-09-22 11:43:15 ferrum said: Raggles: the appeal is I can use it in screen, so it can run on my server and I can access it from anywhere via ssh
2012-09-22 11:43:29 Raggles said: that's true
2012-09-22 11:43:37 Raggles said: but as far as practicality
2012-09-22 11:43:42 Raggles said: I cannot even click links
2012-09-22 11:43:45 ferrum said: I can
2012-09-22 11:43:52 ferrum said: that's a problem with your terminal, not with irssi
2012-09-22 11:44:30 Raggles said: how do I optimize my terminal like mr ferrum

2012-09-22 11:45:45 Raggles said: the only time I used SSH was to tunnel to a hijacked server
2012-09-22 11:45:52 Raggles said: to do mean things
2012-09-22 11:45:57 Raggles said: when I was 16
2012-09-22 11:46:11 Raggles said: a rooted server is a better way to put it
2012-09-22 11:49:26 Raggles said: I'm just running it through windows console
2012-09-22 11:49:33 Raggles said: apparantely that is a shitty way to do it
2012-09-22 11:49:48 ferrum said: just use mirc or xchat
2012-09-22 11:49:59 ferrum said: irssi on windows is a bad idea

2012-09-22 15:51:56 cunnelatio said: b/c the big time bodybuilders all use insulin, so if your pancreas is fried you can use it to get swole without worrying about it

2012-09-22 15:58:04 Stefano said: I hope it's smoked salmon
2012-09-22 15:58:07 cunnelatio said: The southeastern Idaho doctor became aware of the problem several years ago when he saw a non-diabetic weightlifter pass out outside a restaurant. Willey ran back into the restaurant, grabbed some packets of sugar and poured them into the young man's mouth. The bodybuilder recovered and acknowledged taking insulin, which he said had helped him gain about 10 pounds and increase muscle fullness.
2012-09-22 15:59:00 Owlbear said: Wow, you landed on Libra by one day.
2012-09-22 15:59:09 Stefano said: yeah
2012-09-22 15:59:21 nhqe said: cunnelatio so unless you're non diabetic insulin won't really help with muscle mass

2012-09-23 02:11:39 ferrum said: they needed a way to advertise
2012-09-23 02:12:11 ferrum said: and so the thing they came up with was these uh, "crossfit container crates", where you'd have a bunch of equipment in a shipping container, and that container would be dropped in random locations
2012-09-23 02:12:24 ferrum said: because crossfit prepares you for everything, or some shit
2012-09-23 02:12:37 ferrum said: so then they needed ads of people doing WODs in extreme locations
2012-09-23 02:12:47 ferrum said: and apparently the top of the empire state building appealed to them
2012-09-23 02:13:18 ferrum said: then they uploaded videos for your amusement

2012-09-23 13:41:31 Number1Stunna said: like go through those highway barriers (but i know you can't)
2012-09-23 13:41:40 Number1Stunna said: i just hope dirt racing isn't restricted to certain dirt track areas

2012-09-23 13:41:54 Number1Stunna said: off cliffs, etc.
2012-09-23 13:41:57 Rag said: i8m more worried about what they did with the physics
2012-09-23 13:42:00 Number1Stunna said: but i know they won't let us do that.
2012-09-23 13:42:01 Rag said: hopefully it's untouched
2012-09-23 13:42:05 Number1Stunna said: the physics are dumbed down as hell
2012-09-23 13:42:11 Rag said: i fucking hope not
2012-09-23 13:42:14 Number1Stunna said: i mean, it's allegedly the forza engine underneath everything
2012-09-23 13:42:16 Rag said: that would be the worst
2012-09-23 13:42:23 Number1Stunna said: but yo ucan tell from the vids that it's dumbed down
2012-09-23 13:42:27 Number1Stunna said: & they even confirmed that is' modified
2012-09-23 13:42:36 Rag said: i doubt they would dumb it down after the years turn10 has spent getting that simulation down
2012-09-23 13:42:47 Rag said: god they better fucking not do that
2012-09-23 13:43:58 Number1Stunna said: "Microsoft is calling Forza Horizon an "action racing" game, and that underscores the big conceptual difference between it and Forza 4. Where Forza 4 is more of a racing simulator, this is more of an arcade-ish game. That said, it's still based on the very realistic Forza 4 physics engine and uses an enhanced version of the hyper-real graphics engine, so what you're looking at isn't any less realistic. "

2012-09-23 13:44:18 Number1Stunna said: see they use that phrase "based on" everywhere
2012-09-23 13:44:40 Number1Stunna said: also it's 30fps, as opposed to forza 4's 60 fps
2012-09-23 13:44:51 Rag said: yeah
2012-09-23 13:44:53 Number1Stunna said: PLUS you can't tune your cars like you can in forza4
2012-09-23 13:44:56 Rag said: thats not a big deal
2012-09-23 13:44:58 Number1Stunna said: like you can buy upgraded parts
2012-09-23 13:45:09 Rag said: they needed a LOT more objects on screen for this game
2012-09-23 13:45:09 Number1Stunna said: but you can't adjust the bump/rebound on suspension
2012-09-23 13:45:12 Number1Stunna said: etc.
2012-09-23 13:45:20 Number1Stunna said: yeah i'm not that concerned with the 30fps
2012-09-23 13:45:30 Rag said: and studies have shown that the experience difference between 30fps and 60fps is negligable
2012-09-23 13:45:37 Rag said: MS did it
2012-09-23 13:45:45 Rag said: blind study shit
2012-09-23 13:45:57 Number1Stunna said: but the physics calculations are at that rate in forza 4
2012-09-23 13:46:08 Number1Stunna said: so it's going to have to be dumbed down a little
2012-09-23 13:46:15 Number1Stunna said: i just hope they keep the great tire physics a little bit

2012-09-23 14:37:50 BradPitt said: you're like 3 miles away
2012-09-23 14:38:15 Owlbear said: Okay, so back when I was still in the process of losing weight, I lived with my oneitis and some dudes, in a self-declared halfway house.
2012-09-23 14:38:35 BradPitt said: alcoholism or some other drug?
2012-09-23 14:38:56 BradPitt said: wonderbeaver im applying for internships this fall
2012-09-23 14:39:06 Owlbear said: It wasn't really a halfway house, it just seemed like it, because she let pretty much anybody live there.
2012-09-23 14:39:22 BradPitt said: oh
2012-09-23 14:39:23 Owlbear said: For me, it was to get away from my mom, so I could grow up.
2012-09-23 14:39:26 wonderbeaver said: so you wont be taking classes during that time bradPitt?
2012-09-23 14:39:31 BradPitt said: no
2012-09-23 14:39:37 Owlbear said: And hopefully get into my oneitis' panties.
2012-09-23 14:39:40 BradPitt said: learning on my own in the meantime
2012-09-23 14:39:44 Owlbear said: One of those things happened.
2012-09-23 14:39:46 BradPitt said: what age, Owlbear
2012-09-23 14:39:54 Owlbear said: I was 22.
2012-09-23 14:40:13 Owlbear said: This was around the time of the 300-225 weight loss period.
2012-09-23 14:40:25 cunnelatio said: 300 got damn

2012-09-23 14:42:06 cunnelatio said: looks best in may 2012
2012-09-23 14:42:09 Owlbear said: Like if Big Fish was played by some random asshole, instead of Ewan McGregor
2012-09-23 14:42:48 cunnelatio said: do you have a great deal of loose skin
2012-09-23 14:42:53 Owlbear said: This dude made my life a living hell, there. Always cockblocking me, overdoing things I enjoyed, and also fucking my oneitis.
2012-09-23 14:42:57 Owlbear said: Yeah, I do.
2012-09-23 14:43:06 cunnelatio said: are you gonna get surgery
2012-09-23 14:43:19 Owlbear said: Yeah. Hopefully February.

2012-09-23 14:43:42 Number1Stunna said: what is oneitis?
2012-09-23 14:44:08 Owlbear said: Oneitis is when a beta becomes fixated on a girl, and believes her to be the one, and shes perfect, blah blah
2012-09-23 14:44:21 Owlbear said: I was working at a Chinese buffet.
2012-09-23 14:44:30 frogprince said: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0vvCbtf2oCS

2012-09-23 14:45:40 wonderbeaver said: i always thought they only hired other asains
2012-09-23 14:45:42 wonderbeaver said: at those places
2012-09-23 14:45:46 Owlbear said: It was a buffet.
2012-09-23 14:45:58 wonderbeaver said: yea i know thats what im talking about
2012-09-23 14:46:09 Owlbear said: I'd been a long-time customer.

2012-09-23 14:47:00 Owlbear said: I used to just shut down, when Sean was doing his thing.
2012-09-23 14:47:18 Owlbear said: Like, I would close off, get quiet, and go zone off.
2012-09-23 14:47:26 frogprince said: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaXqU7hVVhI&feature=youtube_gdata_player

2012-09-23 14:47:58 Owlbear said: My first victory over him was when I beat him out over one girl. Evidently she had been prewarned about his bullshit, and ignored him.
2012-09-23 14:48:23 Owlbear said: That relationship turned out to be a dister, but she did give me good advice for fixing my shit.
2012-09-23 14:48:52 wonderbeaver said: Was it a fist fight? What was the advice? What happened next
2012-09-23 14:48:59 Owlbear said: Months later, I've moved out from that hellhole, oneitis was cured, I was able to stand up for myself from my mom, and I found /fit/.
2012-09-23 14:49:08 Number1Stunna said: did you beat up your mom?
2012-09-23 14:49:16 Owlbear said: wat
2012-09-23 14:49:20 wonderbeaver said: Ignore Number1Stunna's bullshit Owlbear
2012-09-23 14:49:24 Owlbear said: No, her liver did.
2012-09-23 14:49:25 wonderbeaver said: he is a resident troll here
2012-09-23 14:49:30 Number1Stunna said: wonderbeaver has never beaten up either of his parents
2012-09-23 14:49:35 Number1Stunna said: they are strict. they forbid it.
2012-09-23 14:49:44 Owlbear said: Anyways, after a couple months of lifting, I bumped back into Sean.
2012-09-23 14:49:59 Owlbear said: He was on the bus into town, and I was headed to work, from my gym.
2012-09-23 14:50:09 Owlbear said: Immediately he started up with his usual bull.
2012-09-23 14:50:28 cunnelatio said: do you have monster calves
2012-09-23 14:50:30 Owlbear said: And upon discovering that I was starting to lift weights, he claimed to be doing stuff at home with handweights.
2012-09-23 14:50:39 Owlbear said: I think so.
2012-09-23 14:50:42 Number1Stunna said: i do stuff @ home with handweights.
2012-09-23 14:50:47 Number1Stunna said: what's wrong with that?
2012-09-23 14:50:52 wonderbeaver said: shut up
2012-09-23 14:50:55 wonderbeaver said: Owlbear, continue
2012-09-23 14:51:01 cunnelatio said: I just j/o with wrist weights
2012-09-23 14:51:03 Owlbear said: ANyways, his stuff rambled on, using nonsensical gibberish terms, and eventually I stopped him.
2012-09-23 14:51:23 frogprince said: wait are you pasting copypasta
2012-09-23 14:51:27 frogprince said: or are you actually telling a story
2012-09-23 14:51:34 Owlbear said: I calmly corrected him, informed him that I'm not terribly interested in his story.
2012-09-23 14:51:44 Owlbear said: THis as a true story that gets better and better.
2012-09-23 14:51:52 Owlbear said: FOr me. :)
2012-09-23 14:52:05 Owlbear said: Anyways, after telling him that, I felt him submit.
2012-09-23 14:52:05 wonderbeaver said: Stop interrupting the story with stupid questions till the end pelase
2012-09-23 14:52:22 Owlbear said: Like, that same feeling that I would do, whenever he was dominating socially.
2012-09-23 14:52:27 Number1Stunna said: the best revenge is to live well.
2012-09-23 14:52:32 Owlbear said: I felt him close off, get quiet, and zone.
2012-09-23 14:52:34 Number1Stunna said: you don't have to say rude things to people
2012-09-23 14:52:55 Owlbear said: I agree.
2012-09-23 14:53:12 Owlbear said: That was probably one of the best feeling I have ever had in my life.
2012-09-23 14:53:21 Owlbear said: So it continues.
2012-09-23 14:53:33 Owlbear said: I'm friends with my ex's, we all parted cleanly.
2012-09-23 14:53:57 Owlbear said: All of them turned out to be into BDSM, too. I seem to be a magnet for that.
2012-09-23 14:54:22 Owlbear said: But on Fetlife, the ex that I had beaten Sean out for started noticing my newer photos.
2012-09-23 14:54:42 Owlbear said: She started flirting shamelessly on the comments for them.
2012-09-23 14:54:58 frogprince said: *googles fetlife*
2012-09-23 14:55:03 Owlbear said: She mentions that Sean was still trying to get into her panties.
2012-09-23 14:55:16 Owlbear said: It's Facebook for kink, frog
2012-09-23 14:55:25 Owlbear said: All kinds of ugly women, too.
2012-09-23 14:55:51 Owlbear said: We had a laugh over that, and she kept posting flirty comments.
2012-09-23 14:56:04 Owlbear said: Sean messaged me the other night, asking me for fitness advice.
2012-09-23 14:56:14 cunnelatio said: I can't follow this at all
2012-09-23 14:56:40 Owlbear said: I basically told him to read the sticky.
2012-09-23 14:57:03 wonderbeaver said: Is this where your story ends
2012-09-23 14:57:24 Owlbear said: Today, in his continued efforts to win my ex-girlfriend, he has posted a new picture of himself, with the exact same facial hair I had, when I was dating the girl he wants.
2012-09-23 14:57:48 Owlbear said: I laughed myself silly, and that's where it ends.
2012-09-23 14:57:55 wonderbeaver said: 18<Owlbear> That relationship turned out to be a dister, but she did give me good advice for fixing my shit.
2012-09-23 14:58:02 wonderbeaver said: What advice did she give you

2012-09-23 15:00:50 Owlbear said: Not much time left.

2012-09-23 15:01:05 Owlbear said: Grandpa is 86 years old, and only likes a handful of people.

2012-09-24 00:24:42 cunnelatio said: well, no shit?
2012-09-24 00:24:45 ferrum said: no, that's not how it works
2012-09-24 00:24:47 cunnelatio said: maybe I'm missing the point here
2012-09-24 00:24:55 ferrum said: you can sublet houses without losing access
2012-09-24 00:25:13 BradPitt said: cunnelatio this service, airBnB allows you to sublet your home/room to people for money
2012-09-24 00:25:28 BradPitt said: but there is no legal paperwork requied to do so
2012-09-24 00:25:45 BradPitt said: so, if you find someone subletting their place and it was built before 1979 and you stay over 30 days, you can become the legal tenant
2012-09-24 00:25:47 ferrum said: fucking KSC not responding to my cries for help
2012-09-24 00:25:48 ferrum said: ;_;
2012-09-24 00:26:00 BradPitt said: this is due to Rent Control laws in SF
2012-09-24 00:26:19 cunnelatio said: where does the problem come in
2012-09-24 00:26:36 BradPitt said: the fact that you can take over someones house if you stay longer than 30 days
2012-09-24 00:26:53 BradPitt said: literally forcibly become a permanent tenant of the home
2012-09-24 00:27:01 BradPitt said: "You become a tenant after 30 days of continual occupancy while paying for the privilege."
2012-09-24 00:27:16 cunnelatio said: so?
2012-09-24 00:27:24 cunnelatio said: don't rent to people if you don't want them living there
2012-09-24 00:27:27 cunnelatio said: seems simple enough
2012-09-24 00:27:34 BradPitt said: so you don't see a problem with someone who was only supposed to stay for 30 days ending up owning your home?
2012-09-24 00:27:43 cunnelatio said: they don't own the home
2012-09-24 00:27:51 ferrum said: cunnelatio: it's a tax issue, you have to pay taxes on the rental stuff
2012-09-24 00:27:52 cunnelatio said: if they owned the home they wouldn't have to pay you rent
2012-09-24 00:28:13 ferrum said: and there are standards for what can be rented
2012-09-24 00:28:15 BradPitt said: they can become a legal, permanent tenant after 30 days though
2012-09-24 00:28:31 ferrum said: right, then you can't evict them
2012-09-24 00:28:35 BradPitt said: ^
2012-09-24 00:28:37 ferrum said: they just live on your couch now
2012-09-24 00:28:38 ferrum said: but I mean
2012-09-24 00:28:40 BradPitt said: so basically now you have a new roommate, oops
2012-09-24 00:28:41 ferrum said: that's fine, if that's what you got into
2012-09-24 00:29:02 cunnelatio said: so everybody knows this
2012-09-24 00:29:10 BradPitt said: no
2012-09-24 00:29:11 BradPitt said: not really
2012-09-24 00:29:23 cunnelatio said: ignorance of the law isn't an excuse, tbh
2012-09-24 00:29:25 BradPitt said: its basically forcing yourself on someone as a roommate
2012-09-24 00:29:33 cunnelatio said: yeah except you let them rent the place
2012-09-24 00:29:35 BradPitt said: oh im not saying its okay, i just think its hilarious
2012-09-24 00:29:50 BradPitt said: cunnelatio but the terms of agreement we for 30 days or whatever, but they legally can now stay there forever
2012-09-24 00:30:02 cunnelatio said: so make the terms 29 days
2012-09-24 00:30:05 cunnelatio said: problem solved
2012-09-24 00:30:06 ferrum said: not forever
2012-09-24 00:30:11 BradPitt said: well thats what people SHOULD do
2012-09-24 00:30:13 ferrum said: you can just increase the cost of rent
2012-09-24 00:30:14 BradPitt said: but most people dont know about this
2012-09-24 00:30:27 BradPitt said: yeah i mean hopefully you would tell your landlord about this
2012-09-24 00:30:29 cunnelatio said: they should probably learn about tenant's rights in their city before renting out property
2012-09-24 00:30:32 BradPitt said: and they would find a way to evict
2012-09-24 00:30:39 BradPitt said: cunnelatio people aren't smart
2012-09-24 00:30:42 BradPitt said: and don't like to read
2012-09-24 00:30:42 BradPitt said: =/
2012-09-24 00:30:44 cunnelatio said: sucks for them I guess
2012-09-24 00:30:53 BradPitt said: brb getting a home in SF
2012-09-24 00:34:32 ferrum said: it's fairer to be an ass-man than to be a titty-man
2012-09-24 00:35:03 ferrum said: because asses can be trained through work, girls can work hard and get better musculature, get better shape, firmer
2012-09-24 00:35:09 ferrum said: it's a reflection of the work they put in
2012-09-24 00:35:29 ferrum said: whereas titties are just kind of lumps that reflect bf% and nothing more; they're not trainable
2012-09-24 00:35:35 ferrum said: "thoughts with ferrum"
2012-09-24 00:35:39 BradPitt said: very true
2012-09-24 00:35:55 BradPitt said: which is why I look so poorly upon flat asses
2012-09-24 00:37:07 BradPitt said: I wonder who makes deadmau5's heads
2012-09-24 00:37:13 BradPitt said: like if he has one engineer he goes to
2012-09-24 00:37:18 BradPitt said: they are always very well done
2012-09-24 00:38:44 ferrum said: and it's even worse than with abs, because titties look better with higher bf%, encouraging all the wrong things
2012-09-24 00:38:58 BradPitt said: well
2012-09-24 00:39:00 cunnelatio said: its genetic mostly
2012-09-24 00:39:06 BradPitt said: fat deposition is genetic I think
2012-09-24 00:39:09 cunnelatio said: there's skinny girls with big italian nana tits
2012-09-24 00:39:10 BradPitt said: .trigger rude
2012-09-24 00:39:17 BradPitt said: exactly what cunnelatio said
2012-09-24 00:39:20 ferrum said: sure but let's assume normalized distribution
2012-09-24 00:39:30 BradPitt said: well then yes
2012-09-24 00:39:36 cunnelatio said: and there's fat girls with no titsw
2012-09-24 00:39:48 BradPitt said: but I think women look better at like 20%ish bf
2012-09-24 00:39:53 BradPitt said: i think 14% is like shredded for a girl
2012-09-24 00:39:57 ferrum said: fat deposits go straight to their necks
2012-09-24 00:39:57 BradPitt said: DLB status
2012-09-24 00:40:15 BradPitt said: but then again I think most people look better carrying some fat
2012-09-24 00:40:15 cunnelatio said: yeah being dry and cut looks weird on girls
2012-09-24 00:40:23 ferrum said: BradPitt: I weigh 178 as of right now B)
2012-09-24 00:40:26 ferrum said: 173 a few days ago
2012-09-24 00:40:28 ferrum said: solid eating.
2012-09-24 00:40:42 cunnelatio said: .25 lbs of mucle 4.75lbs of fat
2012-09-24 00:40:46 ferrum said: worth it
2012-09-24 00:41:00 BradPitt said: gjdm
2012-09-24 00:42:13 cunnelatio said: Californian Congresswoman and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro Pelosi may be 70 years old, but she's got herself one shapely and firm figure for her age and a big pair of tits. I might despise Pelosi's liberal politics and think she's an incompetent bitch, but I still get off on the idea of her kneeling down, opening her blouse and wrapping those big Italian nana tits around my cock until I shoo

2012-09-24 23:03:33 cunnelatio said: Today, I saw the doctor who did my arm surgeries last year. I've been having increasing pain in my left elbow and my ROM is getting worse. X-rays show that the bone spurs that he sawed off are rapidly growing back. I'm going to need another surgery soon. And if I don't want to keep having painful surgeries and recovery periods every year, I need to stop lifting weights with my left arm.
2012-09-24 23:03:38 cunnelatio said: It's time to take up a new sport. I'll do what weight training I can after I rehab my back, but it's not going to involve pressing, rowing, extensions, curls, or pretty much anything with my upper body. I had a good run; a 429 lb. bench is nothing to be ashamed of.

2012-09-25 00:39:27 ferrum said: wait until a year from now
2012-09-25 00:39:36 ferrum said: flash support is discontinued on linux except for chrome
2012-09-25 00:39:48 ferrum said: either flash dies or we all use chrome
2012-09-25 00:40:02 ferrum said: (google bought the source code from adobe)

2012-09-25 00:42:20 sabar said: maybe in a club
2012-09-25 00:45:28 Rag said: ferrum if they own flash then what would stop them from making flash supported by chrome only across every OS
2012-09-25 00:45:39 Rag said: not just linux
2012-09-25 00:45:40 ferrum said: adobe still owns support on the other platforms
2012-09-25 00:45:48 Rag said: okay good
2012-09-25 00:46:50 Rag said: I just noticed my laptop has one of those fingerprint scanners
2012-09-25 00:47:03 Rag said: must have been one of the first comps to have it
2012-09-25 00:50:23 Rag said: any plans on releasing a firefox ios/android app?
2012-09-25 00:50:33 sabar said: I'mmm so happyy maaan
2012-09-25 00:50:35 ferrum said: we already have an android app
2012-09-25 00:50:38 ferrum said: it kicks ass
2012-09-25 00:50:43 ferrum said: iOS no, because apple won't let us
2012-09-25 00:50:52 sabar said: I feel energetic positive I smell bad tho
2012-09-25 00:50:59 sabar said: I need to shower
2012-09-25 00:51:03 Rag said: that's shit
2012-09-25 00:51:36 Rag said: god the mobile market is so divided and messy right now
2012-09-25 00:51:42 Rag said: I hate it
2012-09-25 00:51:56 ferrum said: that's why we're making our own thing
2012-09-25 00:51:59 sabar said: and people are not buying enough nokia
2012-09-25 00:52:02 sabar said: it's terrible
2012-09-25 00:52:04 ferrum said: apps that work on firefoxOS should work on iOS and android also
2012-09-25 00:52:25 ferrum said: yeah, windows mobile is really beautiful
2012-09-25 00:52:28 Rag said: you are making an actual mobile OS?
2012-09-25 00:52:44 BradPitt said: the real mccoy, baby
2012-09-25 00:52:45 ferrum said: you didn't hear of firefoxOS? that's why I switched to t-mobile over the weekend, so I can beta-test it
2012-09-25 00:52:54 ferrum said: shipping in brazil first
2012-09-25 00:53:05 Rag said: sabar: I want the Lumia 920 so badly but the windows os is so limited in comparison to what I have now
2012-09-25 00:53:13 Rag said: it's really sad
2012-09-25 00:53:16 ferrum said: it looks awesome though
2012-09-25 00:53:22 Rag said: windows is a good OS
2012-09-25 00:53:23 ferrum said: so much better than android
2012-09-25 00:53:27 BradPitt said: troller is on the beta testing team
2012-09-25 00:53:43 Rag said: yeah ferrum it's a great OS
2012-09-25 00:53:44 BradPitt said: so far his reports are "man this is good should i buy vibram shoes though ferrum?"
2012-09-25 00:53:53 BradPitt said: so, development is really slow
2012-09-25 00:53:56 Rag said: but there is no app market
2012-09-25 00:54:00 Rag said: it's just dead
2012-09-25 00:54:19 sabar said: maybe they need some time
2012-09-25 00:54:39 sabar said: I bet it has all you need
2012-09-25 00:54:53 BradPitt said: no, lots of apps don't have windows ports yet
2012-09-25 00:54:58 BradPitt said: but that will change with Windows 8 release
2012-09-25 00:54:59 sabar said: oh
2012-09-25 00:55:05 Rag said: for what I have available to me on iOS
2012-09-25 00:55:12 BradPitt said: because win8 apps/programs should be compatable with windows phone 8
2012-09-25 00:55:19 Rag said: there is no comparison with windows phones
2012-09-25 00:55:41 Rag said: I wish it weren't that way but it is
2012-09-25 00:56:02 sabar said: some guy is trying to sell me LSD for 25 eur for one "postmark"
2012-09-25 00:56:05 Rag said: everything about the mobile market pisses me off
2012-09-25 00:56:07 sabar said: lol
2012-09-25 00:56:12 sabar said: you can get them with 12
2012-09-25 00:56:47 Rag said: the mobile market is easily the most accepted overpriced thing to ever exist
2012-09-25 00:56:55 Rag said: it's ridiculous
2012-09-25 00:57:00 sabar said: what you mean
2012-09-25 00:57:04 Rag said: and then the dividedness of OSs
2012-09-25 00:57:23 Rag said: sabar: one megabyte costs $5
2012-09-25 00:57:40 sabar said: how much they cost on a computer
2012-09-25 00:57:47 sabar said: wait what
2012-09-25 00:57:50 sabar said: sry I'm bit slow
2012-09-25 00:57:54 Rag said: I noticed
2012-09-25 00:58:36 sabar said: can you twist the iron wire a bit
2012-09-25 00:58:41 sabar said: cause I'm not sure what you mean
2012-09-25 00:58:52 BradPitt said: wot
2012-09-25 00:59:00 Rag said: phones are the coolest thing around right now as far as technology on the consumer level
2012-09-25 00:59:08 Rag said: but everything about them is a mess at the same time
2012-09-25 00:59:49 ferrum said: I just want my firefoxos
2012-09-25 00:59:56 Rag said: that will be cool
2012-09-25 00:59:57 ferrum said: that will solve everything for me
2012-09-25 01:00:11 ferrum said: then I can write pages on the computer, test them on the computer, and just run them on my phone because the web is the same everywhere
2012-09-25 01:00:15 BradPitt said: the only problem I have is that I use SO MANY google products
2012-09-25 01:00:15 Rag said: especially if it's capable of the cross compatibility you boast of
2012-09-25 01:00:28 BradPitt said: which is why I would never switch to like iOS
2012-09-25 01:00:34 sabar said: to twist iron wire = to explain things in more detail,
2012-09-25 01:00:34 ferrum said: it's not exactly, because firefox has more support for phone features than other browsers
2012-09-25 01:00:41 ferrum said: but the stuff is standardized and should propagate eventually
2012-09-25 01:00:52 Rag said: hope so
2012-09-25 01:01:24 Rag said: I think im done with apple though
2012-09-25 01:01:27 ferrum said: I'm also excited for Shumway

2012-09-25 01:01:36 ferrum said: https://github.com/mozilla/shumway
2012-09-25 01:01:44 ferrum said: this is our answer to Google fucking with flash on linux
2012-09-25 01:01:46 rfw said: o neat
2012-09-25 01:01:55 BradPitt said: that name
2012-09-25 01:01:56 ferrum said: we're going to make our own Flash, with hookers, and it's going to be written in JS
2012-09-25 01:02:03 rfw said: and blackjack?
2012-09-25 01:02:09 ferrum said: no time for games rfw

2012-09-25 01:02:32 ferrum said: look at src/avm2
2012-09-25 01:02:34 ferrum said: the comment there
2012-09-25 01:02:42 ferrum said: it's way far along (although for an older version of ActionScript)
2012-09-25 01:03:30 Rag said: hmmm
2012-09-25 01:03:31 Rag said: yes
2012-09-25 01:03:38 Rag said: i know some of these words
2012-09-25 01:04:34 rfw said: so it recompiles the swf bytecode to js?
2012-09-25 01:04:47 ferrum said: yeah
2012-09-25 01:04:49 rfw said: neat
2012-09-25 01:05:04 ferrum said: very much a research project
2012-09-25 01:05:07 rfw said: yeah
2012-09-25 01:05:07 ferrum said: way harder than pdf.js
2012-09-25 01:05:25 rfw said: and i guess you get a bonus from the JIT since you're recompiling rather than interpreting
2012-09-25 01:05:45 ferrum said: JIT doesn't care what you run, if it gets hot it'll compile it
2012-09-25 01:05:54 ferrum said: otherwise it'll run in the interpreter or the base JIT
2012-09-25 01:06:15 ferrum said: one cool thing to observe, if you are really pro at JS, is that since functions are JITtable units
2012-09-25 01:06:28 rfw said: but if you have a bytecode interpreter in JS wouldn't the JIT only be able to optimize the interpreter source
2012-09-25 01:06:30 ferrum said: by creating new functions at runtime, you can actually JIT new code
2012-09-25 01:06:33 rfw said: rather than the AS source
2012-09-25 01:06:54 ferrum said: so for example, if you are an emulator, you can actually generate inline super-fast functions by making a new function, which feeds it to the JIT
2012-09-25 01:07:15 ferrum said: rfw: the output of the AS -> JS translation is JS, which runs in the JS engine as does every other JS program.
2012-09-25 01:07:48 rfw said: ferrum: yeah i'm just saying that recompiling to JS rather than interpreting AS bytecode takes advantage of the JIT
2012-09-25 01:07:53 ferrum said: yes
2012-09-25 01:07:57 rfw said: i am bad with words
2012-09-25 01:07:59 rfw said: :(
2012-09-25 01:08:08 ferrum said: AS is a retarded language though
2012-09-25 01:08:24 Rag said: action packed
2012-09-25 01:08:24 ferrum said: doesn't translate well
2012-09-25 01:08:27 Rag said: action sacked
2012-09-25 01:09:10 rfw said: aren't you dealing with AS bytecode though
2012-09-25 01:09:41 rfw said: rather than the high level language
2012-09-25 01:09:57 Rag said: it's still as

2012-09-25 01:15:40 ferrum said: rfw: yeah if you have the source and not the bytecode and you give them a bunch of money

2012-09-25 01:15:53 rfw said: how lame

2012-09-25 01:18:05 ferrum said: rfw: what other things are we missing JS versions of
2012-09-25 01:18:35 rfw said: ferrum: i think the fact JSLinux exists means nothing
2012-09-25 01:18:38 rfw said: er
2012-09-25 01:18:45 ferrum said: JSLinux is very, very slow
2012-09-25 01:18:50 rfw said: means we're missing no JS versions of anything
2012-09-25 01:18:55 ferrum said: I mean like plugins that need JS replacements
2012-09-25 01:18:59 rfw said: silverlight
2012-09-25 01:19:00 ferrum said: e.g., Silverlight

2012-09-25 01:19:10 ferrum said: it's a good thing nobody uses that
2012-09-25 01:19:13 rfw said: but let's face it ferrum nobody actually uses silverlight
2012-09-25 01:19:17 rfw said: goddammit stop taking words from my mouth
2012-09-25 01:20:17 rfw said: ferrum: java plugins :>

2012-09-26 12:49:05 nhqe said: is it so hard
2012-09-26 12:49:08 workerbee said: because it cooks the egg more slowly and makes it less likely to get that weird gray ring around the yolk

I've been doing this for a few months (it feels great) but now my penis has turned blue/black/purple and is incredibly painful. I'm too embarrassed to go to the hospital so I'm thinking of amputating it myself.

2012-09-28 01:00:23 ferrum said: literally could not think of one, then we tried using the internet and still couldn't find one.
2012-09-28 01:00:34 ferrum said: it's almost comical.
2012-09-28 01:01:06 ferrum said: I mean some specific policy, not stuff like "reduce debt" and "more jobs"

2012-09-28 01:02:31 Rag said: the country has a fucking problem, not the republican party
2012-09-28 01:02:49 Rag said: the fact that there are so many people that support an agenda like that is the goddamn problem
2012-09-28 01:02:50 ferrum said: the republican party could still have been like "no, fuck you, we're going to be reasonable"
2012-09-28 01:02:51 BradPitt said: .d sleep?

2012-09-28 01:03:33 Rag said: not discounting that
2012-09-28 01:03:45 Rag said: im saying the problem lies with the fact that those insane people have support

2012-09-28 01:05:19 Rag said: what happened there
2012-09-28 01:05:21 ferrum said: where one of the questions was "is there a gun in your house" and ~50% said yes
2012-09-28 01:05:32 ferrum said: well it was mostly negative for romney and positive for obama
2012-09-28 01:05:40 Rag said: >NYT

2012-09-28 01:07:05 Rag said: or even give a shitg about
2012-09-28 01:07:23 Rag said: it's the fact that half of our country holds those views

2012-09-28 01:13:21 ferrum said: so that implies:
2012-09-28 01:13:29 ferrum said: 1) rich people deserve to be rich because they worked hard
2012-09-28 01:13:34 ferrum said: 2) poor people aren't rich because they're lazy

2012-09-28 01:14:53 ferrum said: and why should you be the one that works hard so other people can be lazy and stay unemployed and poor?
2012-09-28 01:15:03 Rag said: you cannot even begin to decipher the amount of completely fucked mindsets that the majority our our country holds

2012-09-28 11:42:03 ferrum said: well, she hooked it up to run in its own thread

2012-09-28 11:43:30 BradPitt said: ferrum "lol, call me when Firefox has sandboxing, process per tab, a clean intuitive interface that's smooth as silk and no memory leaks and starts using webkit like every real browser."
2012-09-28 11:43:48 Rag said: call me mb
2012-09-28 11:43:53 frogprince_mac said: well
2012-09-28 11:43:57 frogprince_mac said: the slowness is my #1 problem
2012-09-28 11:43:58 ferrum said: chrome doesn't have process per tab
2012-09-28 11:44:04 ferrum said: chrome has "process per security context"
2012-09-28 11:44:06 ferrum said: that is very different
2012-09-28 11:44:17 frogprince_mac said: and theyre faster
2012-09-28 11:44:18 BradPitt said: i just lol'd at the webkit comment
2012-09-28 11:44:20 Rag said: I though firefox was the fastest browser not too long ago
2012-09-28 11:44:33 ferrum said: Rag: for JS, not since 3.6
2012-09-28 11:44:35 Rag said: assumed it still was
2012-09-28 11:44:38 Rag said: oh
2012-09-28 11:44:40 Rag said: >js
2012-09-28 11:44:47 Rag said: who cares
2012-09-28 11:44:47 ferrum said: Google hired the guys that wrote the Java HotSpot compiler
2012-09-28 11:44:50 ferrum said: and they wrote V8
2012-09-28 11:44:58 ferrum said: while we were trying experimental stuff
2012-09-28 11:45:10 BradPitt said: hear that raggles? they got one o' dem octo-engines
2012-09-28 11:45:12 ferrum said: Google's worked out (obviously, because it was based on already-proven tech), ours didn't
2012-09-28 11:47:05 Rag said: I mean
2012-09-28 11:47:08 Rag said: at this point
2012-09-28 11:47:21 Rag said: how much more efficient is chrome at running java than firefox
2012-09-28 11:47:26 ferrum said: javascript?
2012-09-28 11:47:32 Rag said: yes
2012-09-28 11:47:46 ferrum said: it depends what you're running, we both beat each other at different things
2012-09-28 11:47:57 Rag said: i'd imagine the numbers are near negligable
2012-09-28 11:48:04 ferrum said: there isn't much difference though at this point, architecturally we're at parity
2012-09-28 11:48:09 Rag said: a numbers game to fanboys
2012-09-28 11:48:10 ferrum said: there are just minor tweaks to make at this point
2012-09-28 11:48:29 ferrum said: stupid little cases that we don't yet optimize because we never ran into them
2012-09-28 11:48:37 Rag said: yeah
2012-09-28 11:49:16 Rag said: but it's not a huge deal in the slightest is my point
2012-09-28 11:49:28 frogprince said: support blitz
2012-09-28 11:49:31 Rag said: it's not causing 10 minute loadtimes on certain webpages
2012-09-28 11:49:43 Rag said: we're dealing with a few seconds if that
2012-09-28 11:50:06 Rag said: anyone who brings that up as a negative is a bumblefuck
2012-09-28 11:50:08 ferrum said: Rag: we're not working on JS perf for webpages, we're working on JS perf for in-browser simulations and games
2012-09-28 11:50:19 ferrum said: for regular browsing this is entirely irrelevant
2012-09-28 11:50:25 frogprince said: >mecha khazix
2012-09-28 11:50:58 Rag said: well the same goes for in browser sims/games
2012-09-28 11:51:20 Rag said: it cannot be that big of a margin between you and chrome
2012-09-28 11:51:22 ferrum said: Rag: games likes these: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/bananabread
2012-09-28 11:51:26 ferrum said: oh, yeah, it's not.
2012-09-28 11:51:32 ferrum said: we don't really care about chrome at this point
2012-09-28 11:51:37 Rag said: yeah
2012-09-28 11:51:52 ferrum said: other than for marketing, but those benchmarks are mostly a waste of time and a huge distraction
2012-09-28 11:51:56 Rag said: my point is that anyone bitching or using that as the main reason for using chrome is a bafoon
2012-09-28 11:52:22 ferrum said: chrome has better networking code and does aggressive prefetching
2012-09-28 11:52:29 ferrum said: that's about the only real difference
2012-09-28 11:52:50 ferrum said: oh, and our browser goes to shit if one tab steals all your CPU
2012-09-28 11:54:10 Rag said: okay im going back to chrome
2012-09-28 11:54:21 ferrum said: >_>

2012-09-28 11:54:39 ferrum said: chrome works on linux
2012-09-28 11:54:43 Rag said: does it
2012-09-28 11:54:54 ferrum said: >_>
2012-09-28 11:55:03 Rag said: was it actually optimized and released or is it just able to run in wine
2012-09-28 11:55:12 ferrum said: the former
2012-09-28 11:55:16 Rag said: neato
2012-09-28 11:55:22 Rag said: wow ferrum
2012-09-28 11:55:26 ferrum said: all developers here use linux
2012-09-28 11:55:29 Rag said: google should be paying you
2012-09-28 11:55:30 ferrum said: like, in the bay area
2012-09-28 11:55:36 Rag said: great sales rep for chrome
2012-09-28 11:56:05 ferrum said: chrome is a fine browser
2012-09-28 11:56:22 ferrum said: IE, Safari, and Firefox are also fine browsers
2012-09-28 11:56:33 ferrum said: at this point it's really just up to personal preference, not technical merit
2012-09-28 11:56:41 Rag said: yeah
2012-09-28 11:56:53 Rag said: ie9 really ramped things up
2012-09-28 11:57:14 ferrum said: IE is missing WebGL, which might be a problem for their users in the future if that catches on
2012-09-28 11:57:24 Rag said: tfwnwebgl
2012-09-28 11:57:53 Rag said: I'm just sticking with FF at this point
2012-09-28 11:58:11 ferrum said: I mean, FF is really nice if you're a programmer
2012-09-28 11:58:19 ferrum said: it is so much easier to get code into FF than it is to get code into Chromium
2012-09-28 11:58:27 Rag said: yeah
2012-09-28 11:58:35 Rag said: well I assume they have more of a proccess
2012-09-28 11:58:49 ferrum said: no, all their plans are behind-the-scenes
2012-09-28 11:58:50 Rag said: are you talking about putting out add ons?
2012-09-28 11:59:02 ferrum said: their non-webkit bugtracker is private for all important data
2012-09-28 11:59:08 ferrum said: no I mean actually modifying the browser
2012-09-28 11:59:15 Rag said: oh my
2012-09-28 11:59:31 ferrum said: like if something goes wrong in firefox, you can fix it
2012-09-28 11:59:38 ferrum said: we get patches from random people all the time
2012-09-28 12:00:44 Rag said: i see
2012-09-28 12:01:10 Rag said: is google just more stringent with user submitted code
2012-09-28 12:01:24 ferrum said: they don't work with the public as much
2012-09-28 12:01:30 Rag said: ye
2012-09-28 12:01:35 ferrum said: they would never let a random internet person drive development of important code
2012-09-28 12:01:43 Rag said: right
2012-09-28 12:01:51 Rag said: but if you really think about ti
2012-09-28 12:02:00 Rag said: silly philosophy
2012-09-28 12:02:04 Rag said: i mean if the code works
2012-09-28 12:02:06 Rag said: it works
2012-09-28 12:02:09 Rag said: regardless fo author
2012-09-28 12:02:18 ferrum said: well, you need them to stick around and maintain it
2012-09-28 12:02:35 ferrum said: one-off patches are fine, but someone still has to own the code and review future changes to it
2012-09-28 12:03:21 ferrum said: mozilla is comfortable letting those people be unpaid volunteers
2012-09-28 12:03:23 Rag said: makes sense

2012-09-28 18:19:22 wonderbeaver said: On June 30, 2009, oil mysteriously jumped by more than $1.50 a barrel during the night, to reach its highest price in eight months, the kind of swing that is caused by a major geopolitical event.
2012-09-28 18:19:34 wonderbeaver said: Although not authorized to invest company cash in trades, Steve Perkins, a long standing, senior broker at PVM Oil Futures, had managed to spend $520 million on oil futures contracts throughout the night, the FSA said.
2012-09-28 18:19:48 wonderbeaver said: On the morning of the 30th, an admin clerk called Perkins to ask why he had bought 7 million barrels of crude during the night. Perkins had no recollection of the transactions, and it turned out that he had made the trades during a ìdrunken blackout," according to the FSA.

2012-09-28 18:20:53 wonderbeaver said: The FSA has said that they will re-approve his license after the five-year period, if he has recovered from his drinking problem, although they warned that,ìMr Perkins poses an extreme risk to the market when drunk.î
2012-09-28 18:21:09 Stefano said: and probably pork neck for dinner
2012-09-28 18:21:14 Stefano said: why is pork so good

2012-09-28 22:52:56 BradPitt said: i remember
2012-09-28 22:53:04 BradPitt said: are you still paying off college debt?
2012-09-28 22:54:12 ferrum said: no, I have no debt
2012-09-28 22:54:18 ferrum said: I'm paying off my brother's debt
2012-09-28 22:54:37 BradPitt said: did you get a scholarship to cmu?
2012-09-28 22:54:50 ferrum said: no, my father died and he had a huge life insurance policy
2012-09-28 22:55:37 BradPitt said: oh
2012-09-28 22:55:39 ferrum said: which was mostly lost in the recession
2012-09-28 22:55:46 ferrum said: but I managed to at least pay off college
2012-09-28 22:56:24 ferrum said: when a husband dies, financial advisors swoop in on the widow and convince her to make bad investments
2012-09-28 22:56:31 BradPitt said: im sure
2012-09-28 22:56:43 ferrum said: I didn't know this was going on, and my mother dumped nearly all of it into bad stocks, she claims she couldn't really think straight
2012-09-28 22:56:56 ferrum said: because some financial advisor told her it would be safe
2012-09-28 22:58:09 Bolo said: ah, america
2012-09-28 22:58:22 Bolo said: man i wish my dad had left me something when he died

2012-09-28 22:58:38 Bolo said: i guess he left me these good looks
2012-09-28 22:58:44 ferrum said: he worked for a japanese bank, they took such good care of my family after he died
2012-09-28 22:58:58 ferrum said: they just gave us absolutely tons of money for no particular reason, to honor his ~30 years of working for them
2012-09-28 22:59:12 Bolo said: japs are good like that because they have a high suicide rate with the workers
2012-09-28 22:59:12 ferrum said: and when he was in a house for the terminally ill, gave him basically anything he wanted
2012-09-28 22:59:22 Bolo said: so they have policies for it and shit
2012-09-28 22:59:35 ferrum said: then they gave me an internship, and gave my brother two internships
2012-09-28 22:59:36 Bolo said: >people die >family gets ehlped
2012-09-28 22:59:42 ferrum said: they went way above normal help
2012-09-28 23:01:33 ferrum said: so that leaves us with: I'm the major earner in the family with no debt, brother is looking for a job but is highly skilled and has tons of debt, mother is working two jobs earning ~$25k total a year, living hand-to-mouth
2012-09-28 23:02:19 ferrum said: she tends to waste a lot of money on quality-of-life stuff like landscaping

2012-09-29 12:15:52 frussif said: hope you aren't serious
2012-09-29 12:16:01 Number1Stunna said: what's wrong with those lifts?
2012-09-29 12:16:41 frussif said: 1. its boring 2. its inefficient
2012-09-29 12:16:55 ferrum said: frussif: he doesn't actually lift, he just wants to be in this channel to complain about the channel
2012-09-29 12:17:04 frussif said: i know that feel
2012-09-29 12:17:19 Number1Stunna said: what is more exciting/efficient?
2012-09-29 12:17:24 Number1Stunna said: i like those exercises
2012-09-29 12:17:52 Number1Stunna said: hey, ferrum, no... that isn't true at all.
2012-09-29 12:18:06 Number1Stunna said: i understand that a channel isn't ALWAYS going to talk about the subject of the channel
2012-09-29 12:18:16 frussif said: anything that involves traceable progress
2012-09-29 12:18:17 Number1Stunna said: but it seems that the times I stray from the topic, I get kicked
2012-09-29 12:18:25 Number1Stunna said: and everyone else here does it a lot more frequently than I do!
2012-09-29 12:18:31 Number1Stunna said: at least that is my perception.
2012-09-29 12:18:57 Number1Stunna said: i have traceable progress, frustrated sif.

2012-09-29 12:19:16 frussif said: why not
2012-09-29 12:19:24 Number1Stunna said: because i'm not here to impress strangers on the internet
2012-09-29 12:19:32 frussif said: whats the point of lifting if you cant show everyone else that you're better than them
2012-09-29 12:19:34 Number1Stunna said: and risk revealing things about my real life
2012-09-29 12:19:51 Number1Stunna said: i only lift for myself.

2012-09-29 12:22:14 frussif said: isnt this #fit
2012-09-29 12:22:17 Number1Stunna said: not right now, but he was there the other night.
2012-09-29 12:22:23 Number1Stunna said: maybe he was here too. i don't remebmer
2012-09-29 12:22:34 Number1Stunna said: he doesn't come online much anymore
2012-09-29 12:22:40 ferrum said: frussif: this is #lifting
2012-09-29 12:22:50 ferrum said: #fit is over there
2012-09-29 12:22:59 frussif said: what are the essential differences
2012-09-29 12:23:01 frussif said: no heroid?
2012-09-29 12:23:14 ferrum said: we banned nelo and aguadito
2012-09-29 12:23:18 frussif said: sabar is still here, so thats not really progress
2012-09-29 12:23:21 ferrum said: that's pretty much our founding principle
2012-09-29 12:23:23 Number1Stunna said: this is like #fit in nazi germany
2012-09-29 12:23:23 ferrum said: 'fuck those guys'
2012-09-29 12:23:57 Number1Stunna said: yeah. all this place is about is keeping other people out. it started one day when ferrum got deopped in #fit so he was like "i'm going to start my own channel"
2012-09-29 12:24:08 ferrum said: geordil's here occasionally but he doesn't stay online for long
2012-09-29 12:24:40 cunnelatio_ said: how much do you guys pay for a 5lb tub of on
2012-09-29 12:24:48 Number1Stunna said: like $50
2012-09-29 12:24:51 Number1Stunna said: it went up in price
2012-09-29 12:25:03 cunnelatio_ said: there's $10 off coupons for gnc stores if you have one near you
2012-09-29 12:25:05 Number1Stunna said: just like some rant some guy posted about a coming price increase for whey
2012-09-29 12:25:10 Number1Stunna said: that i read like 2 years ago
2012-09-29 12:25:18 cunnelatio_ said: I got a tub for 43 bux a few weeks ago
2012-09-29 12:25:22 cunnelatio_ said: and the coupon is still valid
2012-09-29 12:25:28 Number1Stunna said: it's worth the extra $ to not have to go to gnc imo
2012-09-29 12:25:30 frussif said: remember when some redditor revealed that all whey is underdosed
2012-09-29 12:25:45 Number1Stunna said: no, frus. i'm not sure i would trust that though.
2012-09-29 12:25:46 cunnelatio_ said: remember when he didn't test free aminos
2012-09-29 12:26:17 BradPitt said: remember when body fortress was only 50% claimed protein
2012-09-29 12:26:32 Number1Stunna said: i think i used to do that stuff. they sell it at walmart.
2012-09-29 12:26:32 cunnelatio_ said: yeah I was unsurprised that the cheap wal-mart brands were shit
2012-09-29 12:27:03 frussif said: so those tests weren't legitimate?
2012-09-29 12:27:56 cunnelatio_ said: well, kind of
2012-09-29 12:28:14 cunnelatio_ said: the test would naturally show everything underdosed
2012-09-29 12:28:40 cunnelatio_ said: so like 65%+ would be expected
2012-09-29 12:28:54 cunnelatio_ said: when cheap shitty brands were coming up as 10% protein that is just you getting fucked
2012-09-29 12:29:29 cunnelatio_ said: just buy ON problem solved
2012-09-29 12:29:37 frussif said: i just buy chicken breast
2012-09-29 12:29:56 cunnelatio_ said: drinkable chocolate flavored chicken breasts?
2012-09-29 12:30:17 cunnelatio_ said: i was eating chicken every day for a while there, it gets old fast
2012-09-29 12:30:35 frussif said: ive been eating about 5kg every week for the last month

2012-09-29 12:31:36 ferrum said: nhqe: $130 for license fee here
2012-09-29 12:31:41 nhqe said: it's fucking bullshit man
2012-09-29 12:31:43 nhqe said: fucking. bullshit.

2012-09-29 12:36:48 cunnelatio_ said: kai green was looking thick solid tight
2012-09-29 12:37:04 cunnelatio_ said: I don't think there's multiple days of judging
2012-09-29 12:37:13 cunnelatio_ said: bc those guys cant stay sliced for that long
2012-09-29 12:38:10 BradPitt said: posing != judging
2012-09-29 12:38:38 cunnelatio_ said: ??
2012-09-29 12:38:59 cunnelatio_ said: do they need to sleep on it
2012-09-29 12:39:08 cunnelatio_ said: reflect on the fullness of the various competitor's muscle bellies
2012-09-29 12:39:34 BradPitt said: they do what is called pre-judging
2012-09-29 12:39:45 BradPitt said: where smaller audiences are allowed
2012-09-29 12:39:47 BradPitt said: like VIP
2012-09-29 12:39:50 BradPitt said: usually no music
2012-09-29 12:40:06 BradPitt said: then afterwards they do the "show" where they pose for audience and TV crews
2012-09-29 12:40:34 cunnelatio_ said: rite so they should be done now then
2012-09-29 12:46:35 cunnelatio_ said: seems surprising that they'd let kai compete
2012-09-29 12:46:53 cunnelatio_ said: they realize you gotta pay the bills but I mean, fruit fucking
2012-09-29 12:48:04 frussif said: yeah because bodybuilding is an honorable sport innit

2012-09-29 12:50:37 cunnelatio_ said: I hope they paid him well for it
2012-09-29 12:51:44 frussif said: probably already makes loads of money with the drug dealing
2012-09-29 12:52:09 cunnelatio_ said: wouldn't surprise me

2012-09-29 12:52:37 cunnelatio_ said: .
2012-09-29 12:53:37 cunnelatio_ said: they should start penalizing the GH freaks imo
2012-09-29 12:53:50 cunnelatio_ said: men simply cannot get any bigger than they're coming in now
2012-09-29 12:53:58 cunnelatio_ said: so the freak show aspect is dissipating
2012-09-29 12:53:59 nhqe said: it's just ruined the sport

2012-09-29 14:22:10 BradPitt said: "There are times when I wish I had a pen, and to be honest I've been thinking of switching. The pump is convenient because it does carb ratios and lantus/basal for you and its pretty discrete. Never had a problem with a girl freaking out about it either. You can usually test them out for like 3 days from vendors to see if its your thing."
